As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and damnation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soteriological mission of cross and resurrection, not
as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From the
beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

with Jared Goff.

Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attributing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. However, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything determines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University

‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

10 Cf. Avery Cardinal Dulles, ‘The Population of Hell’, in Avery Cardinal
Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

Paul](https://www.scribd.com/document/345232762/Rabbinic-Judaism-and-the-
Epistles-of-St-Paul),” _Jewish Quarterly Review_ 13 (January 1901): 19.

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

I live in Atlanta, have for many years, but my heart is in Western New York
where I grew up.  
Academia avoided me as much as I avoided it, though I was never really keen to
participate.  
Petty, corrupt, earnest about the wrong things, if it’s ever right to be
earnest, and uninterested in what really matters. The only actual career I can
ever remember wanting doesn’t really qualify, I suppose. At some point early
in my youth I wanted to be Capt. Kirk. Not an astronaut, mind you, just
Captain Kirk. (I am a year older than you, btw.) I work as a drudge grading
SAT essays for a national tutoring company. This allows me to eat and to feed
my old Persian cat and the many ferals that I somehow became benefactor to. I
write on Father Kimel’s blog, because he is a terrific priest and I rarely
find a place with an atmosphere congenial to my tastes. I have not attempted
to be published anywhere. When I can find the energy, I work on fiction,
because I think what the world needs is better images to nurture a more true
understanding. I don’t generally get too far with it, but it keeps me
relatively sane.

Our creation in Christ has made us, by vocation, into beings to whom the
Father is as essential as he is, by paternity, to the Son himself. But we
should not forget the other face of this mystery, whereby we appear, in
Christ, as eternally irreplaceable to the Father as the Son is to him.
Confronted with the suicidal decision to reverse into hatred the love for
which we have all been created and which makes us, in the Father’s eyes,
inseparable from the person of his Son, could God, even out of respect for our
freedom, abandon forever the person who destroys himself in the self-torture
of his aberration? How could he do so, this God who, in Christ wishes to raise
us by pure grace to his likeness, and promises to share with us the life of
his uncreated Son? Such is the choice of the unfathomable depth of his love
for us. Henceforth there is no human rule, no safeguard of morality that can
prohibit God from loving madly the madman who believes that in order to exist
he must refrain from loving him who is love itself! God’s remedy for madness
consists then in bringing into play all the resources of his love to help the
rebel overcome his insane refusal to love. For what kind of God would he be
who, despite being declared all-powerful, was forever incapable of releasing
from his mortal spell a freedom that was received without being requested, and
that could become a snare of pain and hatred to its recipient, for all
eternity?

You may be interested to know that I was a typical Evangelical, believing that
either heaven or hell was the destination of every human being, but came to
believe that everyone is going to heaven strictly by reading the Bible. That
is, I have never read a book on Universalism – either before or after I came
to this conclusion.

Finally! In this affordable volume Ramelli distills her years of research on
apokatastasis in the first- and early second-millennium into an accessible
format. During the first six centuries, the greater hope was alive and well in
many quarters of the Church. Must-buy, must-read.

Weighing in at over 900 pages, this is a massive work of first-rate
scholarship on the theme of universal salvation in the first millennium
Christian Church. This book is now mandatory reading for anyone who wishes to
advance an opinion about what the Church Fathers believed and taught. You will
be surprised. The universalist hope was far more prevalent than I ever knew.
It was not restricted to Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa. Even St Augustine
apparently believed in a form of apocatastasis early in his episcopal career.
Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the standard
teaching of everlasting perdition became the teaching of the Church.

In this fine piece, Klager articulates a cosmic eschatology grounded in
humanity’s ontological union with the Incarnate Word. He features St Gregory
of Nyssa, but he also draws on the Divine Liturgy and the ascetical tradition
on _theosi_ _s_. He concludes by affirming a universalist hope along the lines
advocated by Ware and Evdokimov.

I understand (and accept) Plato’s view that all willing is ultimately desire
for the Good in itself. That is a question about the final cause of the will.
But I’m curious: to be truly free does the will necessarily have some kind of
an ‘arbitrary spontaneity’ as an efficient cause?

(and then you could go into Revelation with the gates in the Holy City as
being open and not gated… but it could be argued that that was a
representation of the current realities of those that belong to the Kingdom
and the holy city is a representation of the Christian faith at the time when
John the Revelator wrote the book on the island.)

The gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a message of
triumph and unconquerable hope: God will reconcile all sinners to himself in
the eschatological transfiguration of the cosmos. This hope therefore
authorizes preachers to proclaim the gospel in the performative mode of
unconditional promise. This paper was delivered at a conference in Cardiff,
Wales in 2014 and subsequently [published in the journal _Logos_
(2017)](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/preaching-
apokatastasis.pdf).

Nemes critically analyzes two classical objections against the universalist
hope, one from the Augustianian-Reformed tradition and the other from the
Arminian-Wesleyan tradition: (1) The divine goodness does not require that God
save anyone. (2) If human beings are genuinely free, then they must be able to
eternally and irrevocably reject God and thus separate themselves from his
love and mercy.

Thanks for the response, Mr. Hart. I do think it’s a helpful clarification
about God, and I think I agree with your basic description of God as man’s
final end.

Oh, so kind. Again, health is the issue. I began a collection of 25
“parables,,” the first of which appeared as a Back Page column called The True
Helen. I hope to return to that book when I feel well enough. And the. There
is a good deal more fiction I want to write. That was originally what I
planned to do with my life.

A collection of essays dealing with the issues of Hell and identifying pros
and cons in the various views from universalism to acknowledging Hell’s

A helpful summary of how the question of Satan’s ultimate salvation has been
addressed by Christian theologians down through the centuries. “From the
outset,” Patrides writes, “one element clearly emerges: the conviction that
God’s love is all-inclusive and irresistible. The crucial issue, which
orthodox theologians repeatedly failed to grasp, was never whether Satan
should be, or could be, redeemed, but whether Divine Love may be limited in
any way, even to the extent of Satan’s exclusion from Grace.”

May I turn the question back upon yourself? If God were to say to one of two
things to you, either “My dear Yaakov, I love you ultimately and absolutely
and I will always find a way to turn your heart to me, no matter what” or
“Yaakov, you are right, only you will perish and there’s nothing I can do to
save you,” which word would you find most encouraging, most transformative?

That it may generate despair and scrupulosity, I’ll give you that. But that it
violates unconditional love? I don’t understand that. If anything, it
generates and exhibits a spirit of humility, love, and forgiveness.

This book contains three essays by Talbott, followed mainly by critical
evaluations of Talbott’s writings from evangelical biblical scholars,
theologians, philosophers, as well as two essays on the history of
universalism in the Church. The book concludes with a response from Talbott to
his critics. This is an excellent book and well worth adding to one’s library.

Thanks again for taking the time to clarify. You have said that what you are
arguing is essentially communicated in the works of Gregory of Nyssa, Isaac,
Maximus, and George MacDonald; so it may be that I should read them first and
then return to comment.

I am not good at web-exchanges, since I don’t like being on the computer, and
these days I don’t have much energy. So you may have to wait for my next book
for my answer. But two quick answers:

If man was created perfect and free in this way, why did the Fall occur then?
If man (freely and) necessarily chooses good in prelapsarian state, how is the
Fall even possible?

Dale directed me here to see if his recollections of our conversations were
accurate. They are not quite…

Excellent list. Don’t forget Julian of Norwich! I got started on the path to
full-blown universalism through her, especially in chapter 32 when the Lord
said, “I will preserve My word at every point, and I will make everything well
that is not well.” The fact that He refused to disclose the Great Deed that He
shall do on the Last Day to make all things well inspires us to love, pray,
and hope with complete trust and confidence.

I agree with the effects of seeing God ‘face to face.’ I question, though,
whether all will ever come to such a state. Is it possible to see God ‘face to
face’ if great delusions remain?

I can’t believe that two heroes of mine (Fr Aidan) and Dr Hart) are denying
it. Christ have mercy… on us all.

Balthasar did not convert me to the universalist hope. The seeds for that hope
were planted back in the early 80s when Thomas Torrance and Robert Jenson
taught me the unconditionality of the divine love. But Balthasar watered those
seeds. Faith in the absolute love of God slowly began to grow into hope for a
universalist Future. Eventually, though, I realized that I needed to proclaim
a more confident, greater hope than Balthasar allows.

The One Purpose of God: An Answer to the Doctrine of Eternal Punishment by Jan
Bonda

Ramelli explores Origen’s and St Gregory Nyssen’s integration of philosophy
and biblical exegesis in their reflections on apokatastasis. If you can’t
afford her mono­graph (who can?), then by all means take a look at this essay.
Ramelli believes that Origen (and by implication Gregory) has been
misunderstood and misrepresented by the ecclesiastical tradition. He certainly
was no Origenist.

Nemes argues that despite the passages in the New Testament that threaten
eternal damnation, we do not in fact know whether hell will be eternally
populated. Hence we may confidently pray for the salvation of all.

And tonight I read the parallel passage in MacDonald’s sermon, “Love your
neighbor,” that DBH referred us to. It sounds so similar to your heart and got
me thinking, too, that if Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and
FOREVER, then the parable of the lost sheep is a potent universalist passage!
So MacDonald:

That the natural will has only one transcendental end is logically necessary.
That is not even debatable because it is written In the very definition of the
will as intentional. Please understand that this is different from saying that
the finite deliberative will or finite mind always wills the truly good as the
Good. You are confusing issues.

Paul Blowers has advanced a similar judgment in his recently published book
[_Maximus the
Confessor_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199673942/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99673942&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId=ESWZTPE3NAGUMVMY).

Dame Julian of Norwich was probably not a universalist, not explicitly so, but
her visions of Christ provide a strong case for the salvation of all. Clearly
the greater hope dwelt deep in her heart. “All shall be well.”

David, I had heard from Addison that you have been quite ill. May the Lord
grant you a speedy recovery–and if not a _speedy_ recovery, then at least a
_full_ recovery.

I am pretty sure that if this was a dream I would be married to Kate Upton.

To a large extent, opposition to the greater hope is governed by a failure of
imagina­tion: we cannot _imagine_ how God can save all _if_ human beings are
truly free. The logic of eternal damnation binds our minds. In these homilies
MacDonald liberates our imagination and invites us into a vision of the Father
who loves infinitely and eter­nally. “Nothing is inexorable but love,” he
declares. The Father will never abandon his children.

You may be right, Marc. I am agnostic when it comes to the demonic powers, as
it seems to me that all of our speculation about them is precisely
that–speculation. We do know anything about their nature and existence. All we
know is their enmity toward God and toward us. Satan is our enemy. Hence I am
content to remain agnostic. Perhaps they are beyond repentance and thus beyond
salvation.

The eschatology of the Orthodox Church is notably underdetermined, in contrast
to that of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result diverse understandings exist
within her precincts. Turincev’s essay represents an excellent introduction to
the eschatology developed by the “Parisian school” of Orthodoxy in the 20th
century, as expressed in this quotation:

The question was a bit long, but thank you David for clarifying! Excellent.

Umm, well, not in earnest, you know. But, in retrospect, it might be my
favorite in the collection.

DBH: Sophrony replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell,
Christ will remain there with him.”

It may be that I simply have not come across universalists of that variety. I
am familiar with patristic universalists, with a variety of mediaeval and
modern figures, I revere George MacDonald especially…but I probably am
entirely unaware of a great deal of popular universalism.

“To those who accept and transmit the vain Greek teachings that there is a
pre-existence of souls and teach that all things were not produced and did not
come into existence out of non-being, that there is an end to the torment or a
restoration again of creation and of human affairs, meaning by such teachings
that the Kingdom of the Heavens is entirely perishable and fleeting, whereas
the Kingdom is eternal and indissoluble as Christ our God Himself taught and
delivered to us, and **as we have ascertained from the entire Old and New
Scripture, that the torment is unending and the Kingdom everlasting to those
who by such teachings both destroy themselves and become agents of eternal
condemnation to others** ,  
Anathema, Anathema, Anathema! [my emphasis].”

I heard a funny story by Kallistos Ware. He was embarking on a long drive with
another hierarch. He thought to pass the time he would bring this up. Will
even the demons be saved? To which the hierarch boomed, ‘None of your
business,’ and that was that for that topic. 🙂

I guess my question is – if this is true, then why do communicating members of
the Church fall into greivous sin and error? Further, how does this relate to
the pre and post communion prayers which suggest that the effect of God’s
presence can be damaging to those who are unprepared or unrepentant?

For a helpful exposition of MacDonald’s views, see Thomas Talbott, “[Universal
Salvation in the Theology of George
MacDonald](http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/George%20MacDonald%20chapter.pdf).”
Regarding MacDonald’s speculations on how God might convert the wicked after
death, see my article “[The Hell of Self and the Redemption of the Outer
Darkness](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/the-hell-of-self-and-the-
redemption-of-the-outer-darkness/).”

A helpful summary of the eschatological views of St Isaac of Nineveh.
Hryniewicz concludes his article with these words: “Today, after the twelve
centuries which have elapsed since the times of Isaac the Syrian, one reads
his texts with deep affection and sincere admiration. His universal hope makes
him one of the greatest guides and teachers, especially in theological
thinking about the world to come.”

Well, had a look. Not terrifically compelling, however angry. But this Fr John
fellow seems rather unaware of the full Greek and Syriac traditions of reading
the cardinal texts. Someone send him the last chapter of Solomon’s Book of the
Bee. (yes, a Chaldean, but with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Syrian
fathers.) Or Ilaria Ramelli’s latest book, which–for all its flaws–is full of
good citations and references. Or send him to fathers like Gregory of Nyssa or
Isaac of Ninevah, who fully reveal how they understand such terms as “αιωνιος”
or “le-alma” in the course of their expositions. Fr Aidan says Fr John is a
good man. Perhaps. But peremptory certitude allied with broad ignorance is not
piety, but mere fanaticism; and, whatever his personal virtues, this Fr John
fellow simply exhibits neither much scholarly range nor much theological
depth. The thing to recall is that, outside the Seven Councils, the licit
range of theological opinion is far larger than these self-appointed rigorists
know. They do not get to say whether, for instance, Evdokimov, or Olivier
Clement, or Bulgakov (etc.) are less truly Orthodox than they. (Or, to cite
the more moderate, “hopeful” universalists, Alfeyev or Ware.) They believe
their Orthodoxy IS Orthodoxy ( though inevitably they seem to cling to clearly
extra-canonical superstitions like the doctrine of the Tollhouses or bizarre
late 19th century Greek figures like Makrakis, and so on). They also seem to
think the Synodikon and the opinions of certain bishops have an authority that
they clearly do not. Even holy bishops (saints are frequently bad thinkers).
It would be so much easier for them if Orthodoxy had a pope, I suppose, and a
magisterium, and some organ for declaring opinions heresy even on matters not
determined by the ecumenical councils. Alas, it is not so. And, unless another
council is convoked, I fear that merely reciting the opinions (which is all
they are) of certain “holy men” or “holy texts” (rather than others) is not
the same thing as making a good argument. (Oh, but I’ll play along: the
doctrine of the Tollhouses is a crypto-gnostic heresy and those who hold to it
are not TRULY TRULY Orthodox. I make this pronouncement entirely upon the
basis of my own personal predilections and my own unauthorized but very deeply
felt sense of what I have decided to believe is TRUE Orthodoxy, drawn from
sources I have endued with ultimate authority.)

Also it seems to me what you are saying is logically confused. Given certain
assumptions about God (the ones being made in this thread), either God is the
final Good (Good in itself) or he is not. This means that the argument you
cannot avail yourself of is God is the final Good and something else is the
final Good as well. It amounts to saying there are two Gods. But if that is
right, then, strangely enough, there are no Gods, because something cannot be
God, as we understand him, and something else also be God. It amounts to
saying A and ~A which is logically contradictory. Moreover, if both are the
Good in itself, then it seems reasonable to suppose that they are essentially
identical which, according to a decent metaphysical principle, means there is
one final Good, not two.

Totally agree with DBH’s point that our truest freedom is a will at rest in
God as its telos—where God is desired and intended in all things. And of
course I’d agree that wrestling someone to the ground who intends to set
themselves afire is not an intervention in their freedom.

I should have some coffee. Ss Macrina, Gregory Nyssen, Gregory Nazianzen, and
Isaac Syrus pray for us all. St George MacDonald of Aberdeenshire too.

This is entirely the wrong place to do it, but since I don’t know when I’ll be
within shouting distance of Dr. Hart again, I want to say that the moment in
“The Devil and Pierre Gernet” when Pierre’s soul is taken to heaven and the
demon bewails the “gross liberality of interpretation” with which God judges
man… well, that whole passage deserves to rank among the best universalist
texts of the last thousand years or so.

Thank you, David. I first became interested in this view from reading
Archbishop Michael Ramsey’s “F. D. Maurice and the Conflicts of Modern
Theology”, (CUP, 1951) which explored the reasons for Maurice being expelled
from King’s College, London, for “unsound views and teachings about the
doctrine of eternal punishment”. In his Theological Essays, Maurice discussed
the use of “aionios” meaning eternal or everlasting, and outside “time”. Barth
writes at length about this- is there anything he doesn’t write at length?
maybe the Kennedy assassination- and Aidan’s note of von Balthasar’s, “Dare We
Hope All Men Be Saved” I found deeply impressive. T  
he last time I saw Ramsey in 1986, he was reading this and “The Glory of the
Lord”, vol. something.

Unlike the Latin Fathers, many of the Eastern Fathers believed that when
Christ descended to hades, he saved all of its inhabitants. This universality
of the Lord’s paschal work is also reflected in the Orthodox Church’s hymnody.
This is one reason why the greater hope simply will not go away in Orthodoxy.

If I was only allowed to recommend one book on universalism, this is probably
the one I would choose. Talbott writes clearly and well, and he is sharp as a
tack. The book is intended for a primarily evangelical-Protestant audience.
Orthodox and Catholics will be put off by some of his ecclesiological
convictions; but it’s easy enough to bracket them and simply focus on his
biblical, theological, and philosophical arguments. Talbott has a keen eye for
nonsense. He addresses the biblical testimony head-on. Of particular
importance are the chapters are those in which Talbott discusses human freedom
and the nature of justice. The chapter on predestination is particularly
illuminating.

But what is crystal clear is that the will of a baptized person is free, and
that freedom is ontologically a property of the will. And it is also crystal
clear that as our will is sanctified, glorified, deified–whatever term you
want to use–in Glory–and that it nevertheless is in the ontological sense,
*FREE*.

My blog has become somewhat “infamous” for its promulgation of the
universalist hope. You may find of interest my series on **[St Isaac the
Syrian](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/st-isaac-the-syrian-the-
triumph-of-the-kingdom-over-gehenna/)** and **[Sergius
Bulgakov](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/sergius-bulgakov-the-
irresistible-truth-of-final-judgment/)**. They aren’t scholarly pieces. If you
have a chance to glance at them, I’d welcome your feedback.

That’s an interesting question. I don’t quite understand why a finite and
imperfect being might be capable of achieving everlasting blessedness but not
capable of enacting an everlasting tragedy. In addition, I don’t see why an
ever increased pursuit by God must result in the eventual conversion of the
pursued as opposed to the possibility of an everlasting evasion by the
pursued. I am inclined to think that it becomes harder, not easier, to turn to
God the more a person rejects God. But, like I said, I might be missing
something in the argument, or I might be questioning with unconscious and
false presuppositions about the nature of human being.

I think I see where you’re coming from Shane. For my part, this is where I
imagine (with Paul, I think, in 1 Cor. 15) that omnipotent love graciously
initiates the parousia in all its efficacy, and everlasting blessedness is not
something we can either achieve by our goodness or sabotage by our delusions …
Rather, when the True Light shines, the darkness of delusion will be dispelled
and healing love will do its work on our hearts … the synergism of this, I
hope, will be the genuine, willing response of someone being brought back from
the dead (DBH’s ‘third moment’). In other words, we’re counting on a love
greater in its illuminating power than the blindness of whatever veils of
unbelief and defiance we’ve pulled over our own eyes.

Forgive my incessant probing, but I have to ask you about something (related
to created agency) which I’ve had on my mind since reading your book ‘The
Beauty of the Infinite’.

For my own part, it does not bother me that Fr. John holds the opinions he
does, but rather that he wishes to exalt his personal theologumena to doctrine
to which all Orthodox Christians ought to adhere. He wishes for Orthodoxy to
preach doctrine that, in all honesty, would likely have kept me from ever
converting to the faith.

_I have not read everything on the universalist hope, nor have I read all of
the books and articles that others deem essential. But I thought it might be
helpful to others to share the essential stuff that I have read and found
helpful:_

I’m fascinated by the force of fiction to open a way to such hope: Would CS
Lewis, Great Divorce count, as least as the first step across the bridge?

Oh, and there is no “heresy of apokatastasis.” Unless you know of an
ecumenical council that, unlike the 5th, really proclaimed there is. If you
won’t call it a heresy, I won’t say anything similar of those whose theology
is so clearly a rejection of 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 11, not to mention
all of 1 Timothy.

Yaakov, I cannot imagine myself commending to parishioners, either in a homily
or by way of spiritual counsel, that they adopt St Antony’s prayer “All will
be saved except I.” Perhaps certain ascetics can **safely** adopt such a
prayer, but I do not think that most ordinary believers can. It seems to
violate the gospel-word of unconditional love and would too easily generate
despair and scrupulosity.

You are free to go home after work today, you are free to drink whiskey once
home, you are free to be selfish or unselfish, mean or nice, and so on. But
your free choices have nothing whatsoever to do with choosing between hell or
heaven. Your ultimate destiny is a matter of God’s grace, I would think. But
of course your choices can help decide how you go about getting there. That
is, how God is going to reconcile you to himself, how difficult or easy that
process is is going to depend on your free choices, to some at least limited
extent, I think, choices have consequences after all. Simply put, free will is
not in tension with universal salvation, and I don’t see how one can read Paul
any other way and get it to make sense.

Either we have free will now with the ability to permanently and eternally
reject God, and God efficaciously and therefore irresistibly changes the human
will in the eschaton to choose God permanently, *OR* we don’t have free will
now, and the change that God does upon us in the eschaton gives us will that
is truly free and we thus choose God freely for eternally.

OK with all that said…. Which authors or theologians in your reading have you
come across that would agree or created this thought? Thank you so much for
your help!

What I hear DBH and Fr. Aiden saying is that ultimate redemption need not be
seen as coercive if once the natural will is freed to pursue its natural
desire for God. It seems to me that the gnomic will is actually a dysfunction
of the will (and not the will per se) which must be either healed in order for
us to follow the desire of our natural wills for God … it also seems to me
that this cannot or will not happen for many or even most until we ‘see Christ
face to face.’ To punish someone for all eternity without the benefit of this
healing vision of the ‘serpent on the pole’ would seem very unjust. Hence my
hope in the mercy of Christ at the end.

Ummm… and I don’t mean to upset David, who is a friend and wonderful
theologian and philosopher (and thank God for that- I go mad wishing to help
Polkinghorne with some understanding of epistemology) but he writes splendidly
with his futuristic computer thing!

If you are looking for a philosophically sophisticated defense of the
universalist hope, this is the book for you. Kronen and Reitan are both
trained philosophers. They are well acquainted with the philosophical
literature on universalism, as well as with the scholastic tradition. They
critically analyze the classical and modern doctrines of hell, present the
arguments they deem most convincing in support of universal salvation, and
respond to various objections. Anyone who wants to argue against universalism
first needs to read _God’s Final Victory_ and address its arguments.

Silouan did Not dogmatically assert apokatastasis. He certainly held to more
than a mere hope. Sophrony too. This is not something they hid. Merely read
them.

Is it coherent and rational to think that a fully informed and free
person–i.e., someone who both fully understands that God is his supreme good
and is free from delusion and bondage to disordered desires–would irrevocably
reject absolute Love? Talbott doesn’t think so.

He’s ever so much more than an actor. He’s a natural phenomenon as grand, in
his way, as Niagara Falls or Mt Fuji.

I hope that you, Fr. Kimel, and the many other universalists and hopeful
universalists out there continue to engage in the conversation.

I review the argument of Kronen and Reitan that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if the lost suffer everlastingly.

Personhood is not simply a given, but a task. At minimum, we should recognize
that the relational dimension of the person is just as constitutive of
identity as what one might think of as a “substantial core.” Or, if I can cite
Desmond once more, there is a porosity to personal being both in terms of the
deep structure of the soul and our natural openness to the exterior other. We
are “wholes” in our irreplaceable singularity that paradoxically realize our
integrity through dyanamic, dramatic interaction with the Other (an
interaction with the infinite capacity for novelty — the eternal is not
synonymous with closure or some kind of totalizing completion.)

A bit of Ratzinger ( _Eschatology_ , pp. 215ff.) to add to the discussion:

Well, honestly, I know of no universalist of the classical variety who
suggests anything other than that purgative regeneration of the will. I am not
sure what the issue is.

It’s not doubtful in the Orthodox Church — it is only very recently that you
could cite any Orthodox writers who have espoused universalism. The only
reason St. Gregory of Nyssa’s teachings on this subject (if in fact he ever
taught such a thing) were not condemned by that council was because it was
argued that the quotes you refer to were origenistic interpolations. There is
a similar argument that the quotes from St. Isaac of Syria you refer to are
not his genuine writings. However, even if we grant, for the sake of argument,
that these quotes are authentically the work of those saints, there is zero
evidence that the Church ever embraced those ideas, and mountains of evidence
that they rejected them. The odd opinion of one saint or another does not
trump an ecumenical council. One need only read the patristic commentaries on
Matthew 25:45 “And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life” to see whether the Church thinks that when our
Lord speaks of everlasting punishment, he really mean everlasting punishment.

I absolutely agree with all you’ve said. I’d love to admire several comments
in particular, but I’ve hogged enough of the convo. So just one quick comment,
on this:

This has been one of my favorites since it was first published in 1990. The
influence of C. S. Lewis upon Kreeft is manifest. It was here that I first
encountered the view that purgatory is an anteroom of heaven.

For almost a millennia the Latin Church has taught that at the moment of death
the eternal destiny of the individual is definitively and irrevocably settled.
This doctrine is known as the [particular
judgment](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm). But the Eastern Church
has retained the older belief that the destiny of the damned is not settled
until the final judgment. Until then, salvation is still possible through the
prayers of the Church for the departed.

Justification by faith proclaims the utter freeness of the grace of God,
gratuitously bestowed on all through the preaching of the good news of Jesus
Christ. Apokatastasis is but the gospel of Christ’s absolute and unconditional
love sung in an eschatological key.

I don’t dispute our groundedness in God, nor the undeniable primordial God-
given desire that animates the will (as David’s described), the act of every
act, nor that the end of whatever sort of agency/action it is by which means
we resolve ourselves shall finally end in a perfect and irrevocable harmony
with God.

Discussion of the 5th Ecumenical Council is scattered throughout the blog, but
see especially my comments in [this
interview](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/an-interview-with-fr-
aidan-kimel/). Short answer: (1) it is doubtful that the council itself
dogmatized on the matter, and (2) the version of apokatastasis addressed by
the anti-Origenist anathemas (whatever their dogmatic status may be) touches
the universalist hope as presented by, say, St Gregory of Nyssa or St Isaac of
Nineveh.

Macrina seems rather hopeful, even for the demons [whatever they are]. And
this not without some warrant from Colossians 1, where even that which is
invisible is reconciled by his blood (and what might that be?) … and yet
Hebrews says that Christ came for the help of humans and specifically not
angels. And anyway, by the time we get to the desert fathers, ‘demons’ starts
taking on less of a ‘fallen angels’ backstory and sounds a lot more like what
alcoholics say when they describe ‘wrestling with their demons.’ (Anthony
excepted). So what to make of it?

Now I may be very wrong in my attempts to speak of what Austin Farrer calls
“double agency,” but it is also very wrong to call it heresy. The Orthodox
Church hasn’t even considered this difficult question at the depth it needs to
be considered before any such judgment can be made. But let’s assume the
libertarians are right. We can still proclaim the universalist hope: see
“[What are the Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-
salvation-what-are-the-odds/)” Hope this helps.

How all that sorts out is ultimately a matter of trust and seeing in a mirror
darkly.

Dear friend,  
I have been enjoying greatly David Bentley Hart’s thinking on this matter. He
is wrestling with this in translating the New Testament, and is coming to some
fascinating conclusions. We spoke of the two words for (eternal) punishment,
with one kolasis-punishment for a time, for correction; and timoria-punishment
of vengeance. Next he noted that there are forty or so passages in the NT
about universal Salvation, and only one meaning eternal punishment. The
strongest adversary is St. Augustine, not working from Greek but Latin, and
his emendations of the language in Romans 5:18 (which in Greek has neither
subject, nor verb, nor object), and I Corinthians 15:22. And, Augustine is
particularly strident in his polemic against Julian, who riled him as no other
did in Augustine’s late age. (Ep. 101, 4). See Augustine’s Contra Jul. 4, and
24.

I think the most important phrase of those anathemas is from 1. “which follows
from it,” identifying, as DBH has said earlier, the problem is only a
particular version of apokatastasis that ‘follows from’ the broader (and
immediate) problematic worldview — one which Gregory of Nyssa had explicitly
repudiated, thereby not only allowing for his own version, but also
rehabilitating Origen’s? (well in advance of the 5th council).

Focusing on St Paul, Talbott invites us to read the Scriptures afresh,
temporarily bracketing our infernalist suppositions. We might be surprised by
what we find.

Whether Universalism is correct or not, isn’t believing in Universalism
inherently dangerous, since you include yourself? Isn’t safe route is to
believe like St. Anthony the Great that “all will be saved, only I will
perish”?

Dr. Hart, Fr. Kimel, the recent comments here have received a lot of
attention, both positive and negative. Here is some negative attention,
wherein you are referred to as no less than heretics. Unfortunately, it seems
that the author of this blog doesn’t allow comments on his posts.

“The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom is one
in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance, wills
the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to achieve
that end without hindrance. ”

Honestly, what you describe expresses where I’m at (though my questions might
suggest otherwise). As you say, “True freedom as the perfected flourishing of
one’s being is an eschatological fruition that can be anticipated insofar as
one’s actions bring one closer to the unique gift of one’s being/vocation
granted by the creator God.” No objection here. I’m perfectly happy viewing
“freedom” as you describe and for the reasons you give.

Bernier is a Byzantine Catholic theologian. In this thoughtful piece, he asks
the question why should we question the doctrine of everlasting damnation. His
answer is blunt: we must question it because it is “mon­strous, plain and
simple.”

I suppose we all for that. But, really, no citing if crucial texts in dubious
translations–that must be a rule. If Gregory of Nyssa talks of Judas suffering
“eis ton aiona,” then quote him as doing so, as well as the many instances
where he makes clear how he understands that biblical phrase. “Unto infinity”
forsooth. One of the first things to learn about Gregory is that every version
of “infinite” in Greek–apeiron, aperilepton, eyc–is a privileged name for the
divine nature. _Die Unendlichkeit Gottes bei Gregor von Nyssa_ (E. Mühlenberg)
might have been one of the earliest books I read on Gregory’s metaphysics,
flawed though that book is.

Hi, everyone. I’m stepping in here and asking everyone to return to the theme

Wonderful quotation, Brad. Thanks for sharing it. And thanks for the link to

The radical unconditionality of divine grace is the evangelical heart of the
theological writings of Robert Farrar Capon. So why isn’t he proponent of
universal salvation?

If you consult the (very dubious) records of the council, you will find
something called Origenism condemned. But no authentic finding of the council
condemns universalism as such.

This is an important essay (also included in revised form in _That All Shall
Be Saved_ ). Hart discusses the question of eternal damnation and theodicy and
comes down firmly in favor of the universalist vision of St Gregory of Nyssa.
Hart boldly declares that the Christian confession that God is absolute Love
and Goodness, when combined with the equally Christian confession that God has
freely created the world from nothing­ness, excludes the traditional expousal
of the eternal damnation of the wicked. If God is truly good, then he would
never accept the risk that even one of his beloved would be eternally lost.
Humanity has been made by God for God: “To see the good truly is to desire it
insatiably; not to desire it is not to have known it, and so never to have
been free to choose it.”

Gregory MacDonald is the pseudonym for Robin Parry, who has a Ph.D. in Old
Testament studies. Parry looks at the primary New Testament texts that are
typically invoked in the eternal hell vs. universalism debate. You may be
surprised by how well the new Testament reads when liberated from a prior
dogmatic commitment to the classical doctrine of hell. Parry’s exegesis is
thoughtful, careful, and imaginative. He does not claim more for his
interpretation of a given text than it can bear; but he does invite us to a
fresh re-reading of the Bible through a hermeneutic of love.

LOL. I’m going to need to get a job before getting this book but it does look
interesting and weighty.

However, it does seem to me that God’s dealings with us (postmortem) cannot
reduce to his simply overwhelming us with truth to the degree that our saying
“no” to God is rendered impossible. So while it’s true that no choice made in
ignorance can be ‘free’ in the fullest sense, it’s also true that the sort of
‘becoming’ that moves us into participation in God can only be made within a
context of the right kind of epistemic distance (i.e., a context in which we
both know enough to choose rightly and are ignorant enough to manufacture a
false narrative in choosing wrongly—that this ‘distance’ defines the synergy
we value). But if epistemic distance is reduced to zero, does not synergy
reduce to determinism? I am inclined to universalism, but I think configuring
the human response to God in a way that guarantees it will be ‘yes’ is
problematic. So I tend just to say that God will pursue us as long as it takes
without positing a _terminus ad quem_.

As for Princeton, it is all a matter of health. I’m afraid I don’t know
anything about the next two years. Kind of you to ask, though.

I thought the same thing about the entirety of “A Voice from the Emerald
World.” Surely you were a fan?

P.S. What are the chances that you will be coming to Princeton in the next two
years?

My point is just that this journey, this movement toward our telos in God,
requires a synergy in which the specific human ‘yes’ and ‘no’ we render are
not guarantees entailed God’s actions in/toward us (which I tend to see
universalists appeal to in order get a clear terminus ad quem). Thus my
concern with ‘epistemic distance’. Some ignorance is a ‘good’ thing, because
it makes creaturely becoming in the Good possible.

To definitively reject God is to choose the nothingness of evil. Some thoughts
on the free-will defense of hell, with special reference to Jonathan Kvanvig
and Eleonore Stump.

If I have questions, they are not about “freedom” as you’ve described it. They
are about the nature of the words “insofar as one’s actions bring one closer
to….” Is there not a conversation to be had here, i.e., about what sort of
agency or action it is which is the means by which we are to become free?
That’s what I’ve been inquiring after, and it’s only with respect to this that
I’d cautiously employ a term like “libertarian”; not to describe a proper
final mode or resting place for the will, but only to understand the nature of
the agency or action by which means we become free (and thus free of
‘libertarian’ becoming).

Bulgakov’s famous essay in which he argues for the final redemption of the
fallen angels. His argument is similar to that the argument he presents for
the universal salvation of humanity in _Bride of the Lamb_ , yet he also
recognizes that it will be accomplished differently because of the differences
between angelic spirits and embodied human beings made in the _Imago Dei_. The
salvation story of Satan can only begin when he has been cast out of the world
into the void.

My struggle in understanding the inescapable conclusion of universalism still
rests in not understanding why a human person is not capable of continually
refusing to accept God’s salvific offer of Himself in Christ. So I have a
couple questions which might help further clarify the argument.

One might conceivably see _passio essendi_ as being lacking will, but I think
it is better to see it as a compact, elemental gift from which all other
powers derive. It is not so much a lack of freedom as a richness that includes
a joyous reception of being that grounds reason and will. I take it that the
libertarian objection is that somehow authentic freedom would require,
contradictorily, a lack of metaphysical freedom or some quality of the
indeterminate in order to remain free, but this is just to posit freedom
wrongly to begin with.

– On the other hand, that nature “cannot not convert…to its true end.”

I know you said και τα λοιπα. But I’ll add, just for diligence sake, Rom.
9.16, 5.20.

May I identify myself as a former evangelical denominational pastor, executive
officer and Bible College president. I’ve been in active Christian ministry
for 64 years and continue a preaching assignment every Sunday. I embraced the
truth of universal salvation after many years of biblical study, research and
prayer. With this revelation my entire concept of God’s loving relationship to
humanity has been revolutionized.

I still question the logic of a teleological approach leading inescapably to
universalism. Why is it not possible that some persons will never come to
regard God as their final Good and, thus, never freely choose Him? I agree
that true freedom is found in the true worship and service of God, but I do
not understand why some could not remain forever in the delusion that
something (or more likely someone?) other than God is their final Good. Am I
missing an element in the argument?

But I don’t want to be understood as suggesting that epistemic distance in
hell is just this world’s context reconstructed in which we comfortably
continue to pursue our careers. I think if we take the sufferings of hell to
be commensurate with “will’s” depth of solidification in evil and our coming
to terms with this, then we don’t have to affirm UR at the expense of free
agency. That is, if the ‘will’ has a share (by either persisting in its ‘no’
and thus suffering OR embracing the truth of its history with a ‘yes’) in the
uncovering of the truth about God and ourselves that steadily renders our
saying ‘no’ to God finally impossible, then I’m OK with that. That is, hell
confronts us, truth by truth, with our whole history which we are free to
accept or reject. And the death of every false self will be unspeakable
torment as we are left to experience the truth of our choices. Ouch. But as we
choose to embrace the truth, we become more free. Eventually we are wholly and
completely God’s. And the journey from one to the other will be the journey
from experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as torment to
experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as beatitude. The
difference between heaven and hell isn’t geography, it’s perspective. The
truth that once tormented us becomes the truth that glorifies us.

“But what about Judas? the universalist is always asked. Judas is the test
case of the Savior’s love. Will Christ, can Christ, save his fallen apostle?

“Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the teaching
of eternal perdition became the teaching of the Church.”

In the general eschatological context, how must we consider these wildly
categorical affirmations of St. John Chrysostom concerning the chaining,
humiliation and death of hell – its annihilation? Let us state frankly – the
idea of eternal hell and eternal suffering for some and eternal bliss
(indifferent to suffering) for others, can no longer remain in the living and
renewed Christian conscience as it was formerly presented in our catechisms
and our official theology courses. This archaic conception which claims to be
based on the Gospel texts, understands them in a literal, coarse and material
sense, without penetrating the hidden spiritual meaning of the images and
symbols. This conception is increasingly showing itself to be an intolerable
violation of Christian conscience, thought and faith. We cannot accept that
the sacrifice of Golgotha has revealed itself to be powerless to redeem the
world and conquer hell. Otherwise we should say: creation is a failure, and
Redemption is also a failure. It is high time for all Christians to witness in
common and reveal their mystical experience – intimate in this area – as well
as their spiritual expectations, and perhaps also their revolt and horror
before materialistic, anthropomorphic representations of hell and the Last
Judgment, and of the heavenly Jerusalem. It is high time to be done with all
these monstrosities – doctrinal or not – often blasphemous, from ages past,
which make of our God of Love that which He is not: an ‘external’ God, who is
merely an “allegory of earthly kings and nothing else.” The pedagogy of
intimidation and terror is no longer effective. On the contrary, it blocks
entry into the Church to many who are seeking a God of Love “who loves
mankind” (the “Philanthropos” of the Orthodox liturgy).  
A holy monk of Mount Athos,20 a staretz who was almost our contemporary wrote
the following, addressed to every Christian: “If the Lord saved you along with
the entire multitude of your brethren, and one of the enemies of Christ and
the Church remained in the outer darkness, would you not, along with all the
others, set yourself to imploring the Lord to save this one unrepentant
brother? If you would not beseech Him day and night, then your heart is of
iron – but there is no  
need for iron in paradise.”  
And St. Paul, who was so truly united to Christ that he was able to affirm:
“It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me,” – did he not say
that he was ready to be “separated from Christ for his brothers?”  
Must not each of us plead with the Lord in the same way: May all my brothers
be saved along with me! Or otherwise, may I also be damned along with them!
Does not our Lord also wait for us to pray such a prayer? And would not this
prayer also be the solution to the ‘problem’ of hell and damnation?

Brian Moore–theologian, philosopher, poet, storyteller–has been a gift to
Eclectic Orthodoxy. He has a unique gift to bring to light dimensions of
reality that we usually miss. This article on the greater hope is one of the
finest pieces published on my blog.

The example of the Bodhisattva is always in the back of my mind. Shantideva’s
Bodhicaryavatara should be required reading for all Christian theologians.
Technically, in the Mahayana–of any inflection (my favorite being Yogacara or
Citta matra, but that’s neither here nor there), the Bodhisattva does not
refuse enlightenment. He is, in fact, fully awakened. But, out of the
superabundance of his metta (compassionate love) and karuna (mercy), he vows
not to “pass over” into Nibbana until all other sentient beings are ushered
in. And this very act is the supreme enlightenment, because in being set free
from tanha absolutely by his compassion he learns that “Samsara and Nibbana
are one”–for, in the eyes of charity, paradise is the compassion that prompts
the great vow.

This is my multi-article commentary on David Hart’s _That All Shall Be Saved_.
My hope is that others will find it helpful in grasping David’s key arguments.
Together these articles present what I believe is a compelling argument that
God will restore all sinners to himself in his Kingdom.

Thus Silouan’s famous rebuke of the hermit who gleefully rejoiced in the
eternal punishment of atheists: “Love could not bear that. We must pray for
all.” Similarly, when asked by Olivier Clement what would happen if a person
does not agree to open his or her heart and accept the love of God, Sophrony
replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell, Christ will
remain there with him.”

Again, I think compatibilism and determinism are both inapposite to the
question of freedom; they concern a libertarian model of free acts that I
believe logically vacuous. But my hostility towards analytic philosophy and
its native categories occasionally verges on the unreasonable. Simply said,
all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will reach that end,
and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption prevents them; but
rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still, willy-nilly, all
natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as bliss or torment,
but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot not convert the
will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will never be all in
all and creation will never be completed. That teleological understanding of
the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be forced into the
categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I honestly wish
Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories for that
reason.

“But the the Church dogmatically denounced all expressions of apokatastasis,”
the critic confidently declares, pointing to the anathemas allegedly
pronounced by the Fifth Ecumenical Council. But matters are not so simple. The
anath­emas in question were (1) never formally approved by the Council, (2)
are directed against the strange and esoteric teachings of the 6th century
Origenists, and (3) do not condemn the construals of apokatastasis advanced by
St Gregory of Nyssa, St Isaac of Nineveh, and contemporary proponents of the
greater hope.

You know, I’ve tried to talk about all this before and I never feel I quite
communicate what I hope to — or perhaps I am simply not as persuasive as I
would like to be. Here’s another attempt.

I’m already on thin ice, but heck, why not? If your reply shatters the ice
beneath my feet and I disappear into the watery darkness below, I’ll see you
all on the other side anyway because universalism is true!

That Nazianzus gathers and affirms the philocalia of Origen seems a part of
the same project. It would have saved us some pain if they had formally
declared Origen a father at their council. However, it is not without import
that Benedict XVI numbered Origen as one of the fathers in his book on the
Fathers.

Fr. Aiden, and perhaps even David Hart, if one or both would do me the honor
of helping me with a confusion I am having in regards to apokatastasis.  
First, an little background, I have not been received in the church, am merely
a pilgrim searching for truth, but the E.O. church saved my faith a few years
ago and has enlightened much of my theology since then, But I haven’t been
able to make the leap yet, which allows me a large berth in my eclecticness,
but the idea of joining is always in the back of my mind, and so I am always
trying to align myself, the best I can to the church, and so with that, in
regards to this, I thought the church condemned this at the 5th ecumenical
council if I may copy and paste from orthodoxwiki:  
– If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the
monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema. (First
anathema against Origen)  
-If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united in one, when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall have disappeared, and that the knowledge of the world to come will carry with it the ruin of the worlds, and the rejection of bodies as also the abolition of [all] names, and that there shall be finally an identity of the γνῶσις and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema. (Fourteenth anathema against Origen)2

The truth shall set you free! It is our ignorance that leaves us to make
inferior choices.

Oh, I should have noted: the first anathema of “Origen” is clearly phrased:
what is rejected is a restoration whose premise is the pre-existent state of
souls, such that all things must return to the original state, without
personal or natural differentiation of souls. That is why it speaks of the
restoration “that follows from” or is “consequent upon” that pre-existence. I
think we often fail to appreciate that, even as late as the fifth council,
there were still too many of the “holy fathers” and too many participants in
the council who, at least sub rosa reservationis, held to an eventual
salvation of all for an outright and unambiguous condemnation of universal
salvation to have been possible.

I am convinced that this wonderful truth is knocking on the door of Christ’s
church and that we’re on the verge of a reformation of grace that will
ultimately eclipse the one introduced by Martin Luther. Consequently, I have
written and published a book, Dropping Hell and Embracing Grace, by Ivan A.
Rogers, available from Amazon.com, also on Kindle. The book has been well-
received; a welcome addition to the exciting discussion of universalism.

In short, the realization of metaphysical freedom is not simply the product of
individual choice. Indeed, the person as a center of volition and knowing is
always already not a pure autonomous center of freedom, but a nurtured product
of heteronomy. We come to awareness, desire, knowledge and love because our
existence is gifted, our development nurtured, our very consciousness as
personal called into being by God and world. Without the world, we would not
even acquire the reflectivity that indirectly shows the soul to itself. This
also implies, I think, that a universal making new is consistent with a proper
notion of the person. It is only those who think salvation along the lines of
an atomized individualism that dissent.

In replying above to my inquiry about human agency (framed in terms of the
concerns at play between determinists and indeterminists/libertarians), you
replied:

_____, “[Preaching Good Good Very Good News: St Isaac the Syrian and Universal
Salvation](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/preaching-good-good-very-
good-news-st-isaac-the-syrian-and-universal-salvation/)”

So, rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in
a kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny. I maintain that the original gift of being
involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some level,
but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream, play,
wonder, creativity and loving encounter. It’s hard to talk about and
impossible to comprehend. I take it that all our acts of compassion, of
delight, discovery, and insight are those which bring us closer to who we are
meant to be. Also, doubtless, we all fail to attain this calling. Some fail
miserably. I understand the parable of the sheep and goats to be largely
intrapersonal in nature.

I am convinced that a failure of imagination partly underlies the resistance
to the greater hope. If a person dies hating and rejecting God, how can God
possibly deliver him or her from that rejection? The medicinal understanding
of purgatory comes to the rescue. That there is a hell for the impenitent, all
universalists affirm. But it is not an everlasting punishment but the painful
redemptive process by which the risen Christ liberates us from our delusions
and addictions and brings us to clear vision of that Love for which each of us
desires.

I see St. Silouan being cited all over the place as a Universalist. I’m
confused. Based on my reading (some time ago), his famous prayer was “all
creation will be saved, and I alone will perish”. I just don’t see how this is
espousing Unversalism – he is exluding himself.

I wanted to be Captain Kirk too, around 1975. L’hommes d’un certain age.

Dr Hart, is there any more where that came from? You’d be doing English
Letters a great service by publishing more of your short fiction. Truly, these
are some of the most exquisitely written, moving stories I’ve ever read.

Jersak surveys the hymns of the Orthodox liturgies and offers this conclusion:
“Our kontakia and troparia, our typika and canons, are a continuous bold
declaration that what Christ accomplished through the Cross, his conquest into
hades and his glorious resurrection, was for all humanity, affects all
humanity and calls all humanity. They comprise the gospel announcement that
Christ is victorious over death and has raised up humanity with himself.”

I must confess, it’s the only one I’ve yet to read. Perhaps I should fear for
my soul.

Hayes synthesizes Catholic reflection on the last things over the past 50-60
years. This book is helpfully read alongside Ratzinger’s _Eschatology_.

This, in a nutshell, is the reason it is hard for me NOT to be a universalist.
How could true freedom result in anything but one’s salvation? The alternative
would be a god who allows certain beings to remain damned by their ignorance.

I am far more conscious of the many people who have apostasized of any form of
traditional Christian faith or who despair of God’s help because of the
unnuanced preaching of everlasting damnation coupled with the awareness, in
this age of mass media, of all the evil and suffering perpetrated in the world
(a lot of it these days in the name of superior fidelity to the supreme
“God”!) than I do any Christians who do not take the working out of their
salvation seriously because of a cavalier universalist hope in the scope of
Christ’s defeat of the powers of hell. I am blessedly reminded by St.
Silouan’s words here of Christ’s parable of the Lost Sheep, how for the sake
of the one lost, the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 in the fold to go seeking the
one that remains lost. . . . This alone gives hope to my breaking heart. It is
only when I dare to hope that the Lord might really be this relentless and
victorious in His love, that I feel sin begin to loosen its grip on me.

Second, freedom as defined in a purely voluntarist, spontaneous, atelic
movement of the will–pure libertarian freedom–might be denied by the doctrine
of apokatastasis. But that is a logically incoherent model of freedom in any
event. The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom
is one in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance,
wills the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to
achieve that end without hindrance. Thus God is perfectly free precisely
because he cannot work evil, which is to say nothing can prevent him from
realizing his nature as the infinite Good. Similarly, for Gregory of Nyssa or
Gregory of Nazianzus, perfect freedom is liberation from the fetters of
ignorance that constrain the rational will from seeing the Good as what it is.
For Augustine, the highest freedom is the perfection of human nature in a
condition of “non posse peccare.” For Maximus, the natural will is free
because it tends inexorably towards God, and the gnomic will is free precisely
to the degree that it comes into harmony with the natural will. And so on.
Since, after all, all employments of the will are teleological–necessarily
intentionally directed towards an end, either clearly or obscurely known by
the intellect–and since the Good is the final cause of all movements of the
will, no choice of evil can be free in a meaningful sense. For evil is not an
end, and so can be chosen under the delusion that it is in some sense a good
in respect of the soul (even if, in moral terms, one is aware that one is
choosing what is conventionally regarded as “evil”); and no choice made in
ignorance can be a free choice.

Or, who are you? “Brian” isn’t that uncommon a name. Tell me, are you Brian
Blessed (my favorite living Brian)?

“Grigio” is a euphemism for “blush.” I’m a noir man all the way, if it’s good.

That is obscure. Sorry. But, yes, I prefer to think that, healed, it remains,
and that it makes each soul’s reflection of and participation in divine beauty
a unique inflection or modulation of the whole. Which makes each individual
indispensable, of course, to that glory.

Patristic Universalism: An Alternative to the Traditional View of Divine
Judgment by David Burnfield

John Wesley Hanson, _[Universalism, the Prevailing Doctrine of the Christian
Church During Its First Five Hundred
Years](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NOMYCW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eclectorthod-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B008NOMYCW&linkId=9c87d90275c1e730f32aa490532c3466)_

My over all problem with all will be saved, is that the agape we know in God
the Holy Trinity is not coercive.

But I would still say that the final formulation about epistemic ignorance is
defective. Taken to its logical terminus it would mean that we are free to the
degree that we are ignorant, whereas the point is that we become more free as
we progress away from illusion towards the Good as such and the fulfillment of
our nature. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Father,
forgive them, they know not what they do. Etc. And the highest freedom is
achieved when we at last see so clearly that there is no need for choice,
because union in love has been reached.

Keith DeRose is not a biblical scholar. He is a philosopher at Yale
University. Like Tom Talbott, he believes that the Apostle Paul ultimately
taught a doctrine of uni­versal salvation. He begins his article with this
judgment: “Contrary to what many would suppose, universalism … receives strong
scriptural support in the New Testament. Indeed, I judge the support strong
enough that if I had to choose between universalism and anti-universalism as
the ‘position of Scripture,’ I’d pick universalism as the fairly clear
winner.” I certainly would not say a “clear winner,” but the case is stronger
than many believe.

A fine article that Jersak wrote for Eclectic Orthodoxy. He maintains that the
universalist hope remains a legitimate option within the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Do not let others tell you otherwise.

But here I’ll withdraw from the conversation. I will lay out my reasoning in
the book, if my health allows. God bless everyone (and I do mean everyone).

Think of Ware as the Orthodox counterpart to Balthasar on the topic of the
universa­list hope. Like Balthasar, he does not believe we can affirm anything
stronger than a hope. In Ware’s judgment there is no way to rationally resolve
the irresolvable conflict between divine love and human freedom. All we can do
is to firmly hold them together in tension, “while admitting that the manner
of their ultimate harmonization remains a mystery beyond our present
comprehension.”

The relation of divine providence and divine foreknowledge is a difficult,
perhaps intractable, problem, especially for classical theists but also for
modern theists who desire to remain within the mainstream Christian tradition.
This is not an easy piece, but it does shed light and is well worth the read.
At the very least it demonstrates how difficult it is to reconcile eternal
damnation with a God who is benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.

I am not really wrestling with the text, at least not in a moral or
intellectual or existential sense. My only struggles are finding the _mot
juste_ (so to speak). I am, and have never concealed that I am, a complete and
unreserved universalist, and believe no other interpretation of Paul’s
theology is coherent. Geoffrey Wainwright’s review of my first book noted it,
for instance. Gregory of Nyssa, after all, succeeded where Augustine failed:
his eschatology incorporates the whole of the New Testament witness (sans
Revelation, which he did not regard as canonical) in a seamless synthesis,
without truncation, equivocation, or attempts to explain away the plain
meaning of crucial texts.

Greetings, Stanford. Thanks for the suggestion about Dame Julian. I
intentionally omitted her from my list because I have come across two Julian
scholars who deny her universalism. Most recently, see Denys Turner’s book
[_Julian of Norwich,
Theologian_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030019255X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=030019255X&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20).
I tend to trust Turner’s judgment–hence my reluctance to include Julian in my
list. What do you think?

I’m not sure I’d word it that way, but what I would say is that some ignorance
is inevitable. Infinite knowledge is not a possibility for a finite being. I
like to say that my head just isn’t big enough to stuff the whole universe and
its God inside. There will always be more questions unanswered than those to
which we have answers, and a discussion of this sort simply cannot have a
terminus ad quem, for inevitably there will be more to know. We can only
guess, with greater or lesser probability. But I can only suspect that God,
given an infinity of time in which to show infinite mercy will ultimately
teach us enough to incline us to acceptance of the Cross and Resurrection, of
the ultimate gift of Christ.

‘Divine’ agency can’t be reduced to the traditional terms (determinism,
libertarianism, etc.), but do we need to (indeed, can we?) step altogether
outside these categories to imagine ‘human’ transformation or to agree both
that we possess a God-given power to “interrupt” (to say ‘no’ to) our movement
toward God and that we are “determined” for God as our final end (i.e., cannot
conceivably rest finally in any other end)? I’m curious to know if part of the
answer lies in your “however gradually.” If we’re abandoning the categories of
determinism and libertarianism as a valid way to conceive of the will’s role
in human transformation, why should it take God any time at all to effect the
desired end? It would seem, if we suppose the transformation occurs “however
gradually,” that we’re assuming humans retain (even in our state of final
judgment) something of their power to interrupt the natural movement Godward.

The question of everlasting damnation does not possess the status of
infallibility because it directly contradicts the revealed truth of divine
love and goodness and the “happy ending” promised by the gospel of Jesus
Christ.

This is powerfully imaged in the play, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.”
Spoiler alert: The version I saw ends with Judas condemned to hell, Christ
pleading with him even as Judas fades into a catatonic state, and Christ
remains with him. The lights dim as Jesus washes his feet.

Both “never” and “forever” are awfully big words. Could a finite and imperfect
being be envisioned as having the constancy to refuse through an infinity of
time? Scripture seems to describe the sinful man as wavering. I shortcircuits
my thinking to try to posit such an infinite and firmly consistent refusal on
the part of a finite, flawed, and inconstant being such as we all are.

In his great work _The City of God_ , St Augustine identifies seven
universalist and semi-universalist positions that were prevalent in his day
(early 400s). Though he disagreed with all of them, he only judged one of them
as heretical—specifically, the assertion that Satan and the demons will be
saved. Note: he did not consider the claim that all humanity will be saved as
heretical.

This article may be the best introduction to Talbott’s approach to universal
salvation. Start here! After you have read this, you should have a good idea
whether you want to read anymore of Talbott’s work.

Dear me, you really think those are interpolations? That is something of a
joke in scholarly circles. Especially since it would basically mean that
Gregory’s whole theology, from the ground up, as unfolded in De anima et
resurrectione and De hominis opificio and the Great Oration and the Psalms
commentary is an interpolation. Maybe Gregory never really wrote anything
(rather like the Oxfordian hyposthesis about Shakespeare). Something similar
is true in Isaac’s case. And those two are far from being the only patristic
universalists; both of the very distinct Alexandrian (including Cappadocian)
and Antiochene tradition are full of them, from the days of Pantaenus to the
13th century writings of Solomon of Bostra. Goodness, there are almost
overwhelming reasons to believe Gregory Nazianzen, and even Athanasius and
Cyril of Alexandria, were so disposed (Gregory unquestionably, really).

Drawing on Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance, Paschall proposes that universal
salvation appropriately follows from God’s election of humanity in Jesus
Christ.

It is often not noticed that a significant doctrinal correction has occurred
in Christian theology. For 1500 years hell has been thought as everlasting
retributive punishment. This is no longer the case. Over the past 75 years
Western philosophers and theologians have rejected the punitive model of hell
and have proposed what is a free-will model. Quite independently, Orthodox
theologians have advanced the “river of fire” model. Universal salvation is
but the logical conclusion of the free-will and river of fire models. God is
love, and he will not be satisfied until all have been converted to him in
love.

Unfortunately, we lack an in-depth treatment of patristic eschatology
available in English. Perhaps such a work would be too much for any single
scholar; or perhaps someone has written such a volume, and it just hasn’t been
translated. Fortunately, we do have Brian Daley’s “handbook,” as he calls it.
Published in 2002, it remains the go-to book on the eschatological views of
the Church Fathers. It does need to be updated, though, in light of the recent
scholarly contributions of Ilaria Ramelli.

It seems the heresy of apokatastasis presented here isn’t really molesting
Orthodox eschatology or soteriology as much as it cuts asunder the dogma of
Orthodox anthropology that says that baptized human persons have free will.

Harmon examines how Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St Gregory of Nyssa
sought to ground their hope for universal salvation in the biblical story and
their reading of Holy Scripture.

This book shares Capon’s reflections on the parables of Jesus. Each parable,
Capon believes, witnesses to the kingdom now present in Christ, a kingdom that
Jesus gifts to his hearers. Even the parables of judgment witness to the
unconditional love of Christ and his Father. Yes, his exegesis is sometimes
off-the-wall and unconvincing, yet that is what can be so helpful to us. We
need to have our expectations turned upside-down and inside-out.

Transformation in the eschaton necessarily exceeds our imaginative capacities.
I have no doubt synergy is involved. No one will be coerced into beatitude.
Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to me that what you may really be after is a
deeper reflection upon the connection between our temporal becoming and
eternal identity. You won’t be able to shoehorn that into a clear and concise
conceptualization. Poets may elucidate a suggestive image. I suspect art, at
any rate, while it must fail as well, will probably fail less than the
language of concepts.

Like you, St. Isaac had a huge influence on me, hence my baptismal name.
Nobody here will turn you away for that. It is a great, thoughtful and
welcoming community that will be happy to have you.

I don’t know if this analogy will help, but I think modern, voluntarist
notions of freedom are akin to the way scientism approaches the existence of
reality. Scientism never really asks the question of why there is something
rather than nothing. It can’t understand that an infinite series of finite
causes still can’t address origins — or even feel the need for such,
apparently. Similarly, voluntarism is fixated on finite, concrete situations
and never sees that the source of freedom is prior and other.

To the list of “Julian was NOT a universalist” scholars you may add Fr. John
Julian, OJN, whose translation and commentary are published by Paraclete Press
under the title “The Complete Julian of Norwich”. Among other things, he
points out that she frequently used the phrase “all who shall be saved”,
implying that not all will be saved. Certainly she was not an avowed
universalist as were Saints Gregory of Nyssa of Isaac the Syrian. However, I
think she was so in pectore, but given the doctrinal and ecclesiastical
climate of Fourteenth Century England, she could only lead her reader to that
truth inferentially. And I think she does so beautifully.

I’m sure Ilaria Ramelli’s recent tome “The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis” will become an essential standard.

Belt is not a patristic scholar and certainly not an expert on St Maximus (who
is?), but he is a thoughtful reader and theologian. In this article he
reflects on Maximus’s _Ambiguum_ 7 and wonders whether Maximus’ metaphysics
and understanding of God logically leads to universal salvation, even if the
great Church Father never connected the dots.

Saint Silouan was famous for saying, “all will be saved, and I alone will
perish”. That is not Universalism, it’s humility.

Ludlow examines the eschatological convictions of St Gregory Nyssen in detail.
“Whoever considers the divine power,” Gregory writes, “will plainly perceive
that it is able at length to restore by means of the _aionion_ purging and
atoning sufferings, those who have gone even to this extremity of wickedness.”
Hell is purgation that culmi­nates in salvation. Gregory’s views on the
apocatastasis were not condemned by the Church at the 5th Ecumenical Council
and would later profoundly influence the eschatological reflection of Sergius
Bulgakov.

Bringing together Origen, St Gregory Nyssen, and George MacDonald, Ross argues
that universal salvation “entails a concept of judgment just as exacting, just
as rigorous, and every bit as righteous as the sort of purely punitive
punishment on offer in any version of the doctrine of eternal damnation.”

Perhaps my fears are inspired by versions of universalism I’ve encountered in
which people imagine God instantaneously kicking the doors of our hearts open
and blasting all falsehood away, essentially leaving us no other option but
God, in which circumstance we ‘make the right choice’. I confess I find it
difficult to believe God would be very interested in our coming to conclude he
is our only option under such conditions. But that doesn’t seem to be
anybody’s position here.

The traditional view says no. Death finalizes the sinner’s orientation to God.
But why believe this is so? All explanations seem fatuous and unconvincing.
They presuppose the doctrine of everlasting damnation. In this piece I
summarize the view of the great Sergius Bulgakov. Bulgakov dismisses the
school opinion that death freezes the human person: “the disincarnation in
death does not suppress the activity of the spirit.” The afterlife presents
new possibilities!

But also, and perhaps a bigger misunderstanding for me, is, isn’t universalism
deterministic, does it not require one to be mongerstic, where does free
agency come in, if we can boldly say that all WILL be saved, rather than
reserving judgment and saying all MAY be saved, for if even only one is
allowed his freedom and chooses to shrink away from the humanity and divinity
he was created for, in essence, in hell, moving in the opposite direction of
theosis. Would this not then render universalism false? This of course
presupposing synergism, whereas if we say all WILL be, then are we not
mongerist? Is it not simple the moral form of determinism?

Do the Fathers differ on how free will and providence interact? Absolutely. Do
they differ on how grace and free will relates to “nature” of a person?
Absolutely. Are there various interpretations about how the post-lapsarian
will is wounded? Absolutely. Various interpretations about how a free will
really operates in the eschaton? Absolutely.

Resistance was futile. I’ve just been compelled (in Borg-like fashion) to
purchase the Devil and Pierre. 3 pages in … Screwtape on crack?

Brad J: As it happens, I ordered your book from amazon just yesterday. Looking
forward to getting it and reading it. I enjoyed a blog post of yours from some
time ago about (among other things) the two Gregorys.

Daniel, have you considered the possibility that you are confusing creaturely
causality and divine causality? As I have expressed in a couple of my past
postings, popular understandings of synergism appear to put God in the same
metaphysical level (just as so many analytic philosophers do today). Hence
they present human freedom and divine action as mutually competitive. But this
simply cannot be the right way to think about the relationship between the
Transcendence and human beings. Take a look at these past articles of mine:

Kronen & Reitan analyze the philosophical case for annihilationism in light of
the arguments advanced in their book. Bottomline: annihilationism suffers from
many of the same flaws as does infernalism.

I had a professor in seminary that spoke of one theory that arises from the
question, “What about the salvation of God’s chosen people the Jews? (for the
evangelicals) Those before Jesus that it was and could have been credited to
them salvation by faith). And the theory went something like this: When Jesus
returns EVERYONE is resurrected and every tongue confessing and every knee
bowing that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, Lord, and King. And it would be at
that point that the Jews would see the messiah coming in the way that they
have always been expecting. And everyone would be able to either recognize the
one and true God and choose to continue to be in relationship with the God, or
they would be wooed by the Holy Spirit to desire to start that relationship
beyond this life. And of course, for anyone that chooses to not be in
relationship with our three-fold Godhead, then there would be a place for them
that would not be in the presence and relationship with God, and that would be
like eternal torment to choose to not be in a relationship with the Trinity
that they were create to be in.

I wouldn’t suggest that the more ignorant we are the more free we are.
Epistemic distance is qualified on both ends. It can’t be maximized, for then
we would be absolutely ignorant and incapable of choosing God. We have to be
sufficiently informed, obviously. But can the distance be reduced to zero, in
which case we would be so informed, so overwhelmed by the truth, that no
possible means of constructing a ‘no’ to God would be possible?

Fr Coleman, that is fascinating news! I had heard that Hart had been
commissioned to translate the NT (or the entire Bible?). I hope that Hart will
eventually share with the rest of us the conclusions of his study.

The classic evangelical work on retributive annihilationism. Not a position
with which I am particularly sympathetic—the hermeneutics that grounds the
project is all wrong, but it contains a lot of useful information.

Andreano identifies the misconceptions many people have about what
universalists believe and answers the common objections advanced against the
greater hope.

There is no verse in the New Testament that unambiguously threatens eternal
punishment. There are three that are regularly invoked by the Hellfire Club
(my fond name for those who have some emotional commitment to the idea of a
hell of eternal torment), but none of them really says what they imagine it
says. Conversely, the seemingly very clear statements of universal salvation
number quite high (47 at my last casual count).

Hi, Brad. Welcome to Eclectic Orthodoxy. I have your book sitting on my shelf,
but I haven’t read it yet. One of these days … 🙂

Potentially, every source of delusion would be removed or healed when we ‘see
him face to face’ … the telos would be an experience of pure clarity to a
graciously restored mind and will.

If human beings are made by God and for God, if the Holy Trinity is their
ultimate Good, only in whom they may find the happiness they desire toward
whom their consciousness is teleologically directed, then we may not entertain
the possibility that they could irrevocably close themselves off to Love.
God’s salvific will cannot be eternally stymied. _That All Shall Be Saved_ has
brought apokatastasis back to the catholic table. See my series which seeks to
explicate Hart’s arguments: “[Apprehending
Apokatastasis](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/apprehending-
apokatastasis-the-incoherence-of-everlasting-perdition/).”

I’ll presume to suggest my own work, ‘Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hope, Hell
and the New Jerusalem,’ (Wipf and Stock, 2009), which offers a chapter on
Jesus in the Jeremiah tradition, where he consciously quotes or alludes to
every chapter of Jeremiah where ‘the Valley of Hinnom’ is mentioned (and is
symbolic of the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon – i.e. literal destruction) …
surely this plays into Jesus’ use of gehenna in conjunction with the
forthcoming siege in 70. (in part).

On reflection, I think the first. However, I think that the first statement is
kind of a given, even in St. Anthony’s statement. It’s not that God will not
find a way to turn our heart to him, but that we don’t accept his invitation.

If you happen to visit these comments again, I am curious to know your
response to those who claim that the belief in universalism is a heresy since
it was (supposedly) condemned by the fifth ecumenical council.

Hi, Eric. For my own thoughts about the Fifth Ecumenical Council, see “[The
Heresy That Never Was](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/apocatastasis-
the-heresy-that-never-was/).”

Somewhere in my library I have a mid-19thC volume of interest: “The Ancient
History of Universalism”, by Hosea Ballou. Ballou was a consistent Calvinist
who came to modify his position by a belief in universal election, and went on
to found the Universalist Church, which, regrettably developed to an extreme
liberalism and has merged with the Unitarians. His book is interesting, adding
to a Scriptural exposition a surprising knowledge of patristics. I’ve read it
through more than once, and find myself not convinced of universalism as a
doctrine. I don’t think we can go that far. But it did leave me ready to hold
a universalist hope similar to many of those you quote.

Yes, I own it, and I agree–it should be on the list. I’ll add it. Thanks.

As for Dogen, the issue of enlightenment (or, technically, awakening) is a
somewhat different issue. But, of course, you are right that knowledge of
anything is not merely a discursive mastery of its attributes, but an
encounter, an intellectual intuition, in which there must be a surfeit of
mystery, or in which the intellect falls silent in being subsumed into…well,
ideally love. That is the yield of apophatic discipline in Maximus, after all.

Let me try to clarify. Let’s reserve ‘freedom’ for that mode of human agency
fulfilled and glorified in God, our truest freedom in Christ. Let ‘agency’
describe that mode of the will en route to such freedom. I’m suggesting only
that the latter be characterized by a certain epistemic distance/space and
that this distance serves a good purpose, namely, it’s an essential part of
what makes it possible for finite created beings such as ourselves to come to
be free (in the former sense) in God. So ‘freedom’ is the result of a
particular exercise of an ‘agency’ that is sufficiently informed but not
overwhelmed as such.

As for quoting the anathemas of the 5th Council: again, the council never
really had anything to do with them, they are a separate and irregular set of
condemnations, and even so they do not condemn universalism as such, and if
one cannot see that clearly then one is not reading the text, but only one’s
prejudices through the text.

Hi, everyone. I am temporarily closing the comments on this page. It really is
not intended for extended discussion, but I allowed it to continue because we
often do not get a visitor of the intellectual caliber of David Hart. My
special thanks to David for addressing our many questions.

If you’re just beginning to reflect on eternal damnation, this may be the book
with which to begin. Four Protestant scholars present the retributive,
annihilationist, free will, and universalist positions and respond to the
contributions of the others. Robin Parry’s essay on universalism is
particularly fine.

Having read your series, it seems like St. Isaac believes in pre-destination.
I wonder how he would have reacted to the conversation between Ivan and
Alyosha in Brothers K?

The benefit of this view is that it still agrees with Jesus’ saying of, “No
one comes to the Father except through me” and allows for a Christian world
view when it comes to the potential of universalism. It’s not that all faiths
and religions lead to the same God, but that they could bring up different
aspects of Christianity that when Christ does return, they could recognize the
Jesus was the one all along, and the Holy Spirit has been wooing them all
along, and the Creator Covenant God does desire to be in relationship with us
all.

Andreas Andreapoulos, “[Eschatology and final restoration (apokatastasis) in
Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and Maximos the
Confessor](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/andropoulos-on-
apokatastasis-in-origen-gregory-of-nyssa-and-maximus-the-confessor.pdf)”

What that has to do with universalism is that, if it as persons that we are
saved, having achieved personhood through communion, rather than as abstract
essences, then the notion of an eternal hell becomes not only a problem for,
but an absolute barrier to, a coherent concept of salvation. But my dog needs
to be walked, so I can’t explain that now.

Human beings are not created in a neutral state _vis-à-vis_ their Creator.
They are created with a natural desire for union with him.

Part of the difficulty is that one should not isolate freedom and identity as
if one could focus purely on the individual. There’s the story in the
Brother’s Karamazov about the old woman in hell who once gave an onion to a
beggar. An angel tries to pull her out from infernal chains by the strength of
that single act of charity. Other souls try to cling to her and gain release
as well, and the old woman shouts, “it’s mine, mine” — and tumbles back into
the flames, of course. There is also Father Zossima’s mysterious claim that
“each is responsible for all.” This can only be an irrational puzzle for those
who have imbibed the ethos of modern, western individualism. But if the Triune
God is the exemplar of what it means to be a person, our creaturely experience
is analogous and only partially, incompletely, imperfectly approaches genuine
personhood.

And, had our our Lord spoken of everlasting punishment, that would be an
interesting argument. But he did not speak English, and in fact did not speak
Greek; and the Greek text of Matthew 25:46 (which is the only one you can have
in mind) has been read by a great many Greek-speaking and Syriac-speaking
fathers, from the earliest days, as saying nothing of the sort.

Well, its perfect harmonization with, restoration to, and ultimate
indistinction from the natural will. But, then, that is not elimination, but
rather salvation.

The question is based on an ontological confusion, and a naive
anthropomorphism. Sorry to sound arch, but you are not thinking of God as God.
Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot
simply turn away towards “something else.” He is the ground and end of all
desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not
choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire
anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good
and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual
appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee
God, you are desiring God as the “good end” you seek in godlessness. He is
inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are
God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but
an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural
will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don’t think of God as a candidate in
a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the
original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages,
since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will
is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an
object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.

Chenoweth surveys the key texts in St Maximus’s writings and concludes that if
he was not an outright universalist, he was certainly sympathetic to it.
Superficially Maximus appears to have affirmed universal damnation, yet there
are many elements in his theology that point to apokatastasis.

I have always liked Mr. Blessed’s work. It cheers my heart to hear this.

I don’t follow. Is belonging to the Church the same thing as being rendered
magically sinless? And who denies that one can suffer spiritual harm? I am
sorry, but your question does not seem to have any relation to the claim being
made ( which, incidentally, is exactly the same claim as Maximus the Confessor
makes about freedom).

Fr Aidan call tell you how long I’ve complained about the idea that postmortem
salvation proceeds via an overwhelming revelation of truth that effectively
determines our ‘yes’ for God. ;o

In modern times some Orthodox have begun to claim that all local synods and
councils are doctrinal authoritative and so Orthodoxy has just as many exact
doctrinal formulae as Rome. Call it magisterium-envy. But in fact the ancient
canonical view is that only an ecumenical council can ratify a synod as
doctrinally binding. And it’s been a while, you know.

As it happens, I number among my friends and acquaintances some of the
greatest scholars of Orthodox canons and councils and history in the world;
and to a man they would assert that the Orthodox Church–no matter what the
inclinations of its catechists and prelates may have been down the ages–has
never definitively condemned universalism as such, or even addressed it under
any synodical or conciliar conditions of special import. It has condemned some
teachings that are also, as it happens, universalist. But the sort of
universalism found in Gregory and Isaac, which fully acknowledges the reality
of judgment and hell, has never even been addressed.

“On the one hand, Maximus foresees the restoration of the natural will and
speaks of the purifying fire of the Second Coming, something that implies an
end to the puri­fication process, but, on the other hand, he emphasizes the
final rest. Perhaps the answer can be found in a comment from the Q.Thal. 22
(Laga–Steel 1980: 139. 66–141. 80) where Maximus draws a distinction between
the present age, the ‘age of the flesh’, which is characterized by doing, and
the age of the Spirit that will be charac­terized by ‘undergoing’. This
suggests that the final rest will not be a static rest, but that some kind of
activity is conceivable. In addition, it is not specified if the activity of
that age is limited to the righteous only: the analogy to the age of doing
suggests the opposite. Is it possible, then, that with the mysterious phrase
‘ever-moving rest’ ( _ἀεικίνητος στάσις_ ), the Confessor envisioned a rest
similar to the unification of the soul with God, as described by Gregory of
Nyssa, where the soul moves infinitely towards God without ever being able to
reach the end of infinity, but experiencing and participating increasingly in
the divine energies? The ‘undergoing’ of the sinful souls might then be
translated into the contrition and repentance they never had in life, which
could perhaps even then bring them closer to God, while the righteous advance
in their blissful participation of the divine. Something like that would be
consistent with the possibility of a final restoration of all and with
Maximus’ views on the rest. This active rest would have to be understood as an
unchangeable condition, in spite of the movement or undergoing of the souls,
something that would satisfy its position at the end of the Maximian
cosmological triad as the conclusion. It would also mean that it is not
necessary to envision an ontological difference between the righteous and the
wicked, as there is not one now.”

That said, it also seems to me that in light of this, ‘will’ may not be the
locus of salvation in the first place, but rather the ‘nous.’ Briefly, worries
about coercion (the will of God imposed) or ‘free’ vs. ‘bondage’ of the human
will are all still fixated on the primacy of the will in salvation (whether
God’s or our own). However, what I in Scripture is that the divine Nous both
creates and enlightens the God-given human ‘nous’ (the eyes of the heart/mind,
poorly translated ‘intellect’) in order to ‘see the light of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ’ (2 Cor. 4) … something we cannot see as long as
we’re blinded by the god of this age. For whatever reason, some see in this
age and some do not (where ‘see’ is also a metaphor for love). Paul says that
apart from this ‘seeing,’ we cannot respond. And yet if we do ‘see,’ we are
capacitated for an uncoerced response.

The publication of _That All Shall Be Saved_ in 2019 was a major event. It
pushed the question of universal salvation to the theological front-burner.
The majority of online reviews, though, suggest that the brethren would rather
dismiss the universalist thesis as outright heresy rather than engage it
constructively and substantively. Fortunately all is not lost.

“But it is a wild question. God is, and shall be, All in all. Father of our
brothers and sisters! You will not be less glorious than we, taught of Christ,
are able to think You. When You go into the wilderness and seek, You will not
come home until you have found. It is because we hope not for them in You, not
knowing Your love, that we are so hard and so heartless to the brothers and
sisters You have given us.”

Roberto De La Noval, “[We Shall See Him As He Is: Bulgakov On Eschatological
Conversion](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/we-shall-see-him-as-he-
is-bulgakov-on-eschatological-conversion/).”

Standing under the judgment of the Cross (and bound by Catholic dogma), we may
not assert apokatastasis, says Balthasar; but we may—and indeed must—pray for
the salvation of all. Universal restoration in Christ is a possibility for
which we may hope, but can never be a certainty we may proclaim.

It used to trouble me, as a young aspiring student of Asian religions, that
the typical way in which the work of Christ was preached from pulpits made it
seem not only that our God is morally inferior to the bodhisattva, but that in
fact Christianity was burdened by a thwarted moral imagination, and that the
Mahayana made this obvious. Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald and Isaac of
Ninevah (etc.) prevented me from abandoning the faith as an ungainly alloy of
the ennobling and the barbaric.

Have you read “Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives”? In it, Elder Thaddeus
presents an image of heaven/hell that I don’t think fits into the “River of
Fire” or Divine Retribution categories.

“St. Paul would be wretched before the throne of God, if he thought there was
one man beyond the pale of His mercy, and that as much for God’s glory as for
the man’s sake. And what shall we say of the man Christ Jesus? Who, that loves
his brother, would not, upheld by the love of Christ, and with a dim hope that
in the far-off time there might be some help for him, arise from the company
of the blessed, and walk down into the dismal regions of despair, to sit with
the last, the only unredeemed, the Judas of his race, and be himself more
blessed in the pains of hell, than in the glories of heaven?

Lastly, let me say in case I don’t get another chance, I have really benefited
from your writing and lectures. Particularly, I really enjoyed your article on
baseball. But, more seriously, I’ve been working through Beauty of the
Infinite and being challenged throughout. So thank you, and I pray you’ll be
afforded the health to continue writing.

“We need to understand human being and agency not as a limit to God—created by
and as God’s act of self-limitation—but as existing within God’s freedom and
because of it, in absolute dependence on God’s supremacy. We need a way of
saying that God wills our free response and that our response is truly free
just because God wills it.”

In this sophisticted work Griffiths argues for a free-will annihilationism:
human beings are ultimately free to embrace sin and pass into the nothingness
from which they were created. What makes his arguments particularly
interesting—and surprising—is that he is a Roman Catholic who seeks to norm
his reflections by the infallible pronouncements of the Magisterium. With
Balthasar, Griffiths believes that we must pray for the salvation of all,
though he deems the prospect unlikely, although not impossible. He agrees with
the universalist that the traditional claim that God would resurrect the dead
in order to condemn them to everlasting perdition violates the revealed
character of God as infinite and absolute Love.

The greater hope is ultimately grounded in a vision of God as absolute,
unconditional Love. If this vision is true, then the doctrine of everlasting
damnation becomes both incomprehensible and morally intolerable.

William Desmond draws a distinction between the _conatus essendi_ (the
striving, struggle for living) and the _passio essendi_ (the pure giftedness
of our being which is the prior foundation upon which the latter derives.)
Modernity is largely blind to the _passio essendi_ and it would not see it as
freedom. Instead, it identifies freedom with something that is derivative,
secondary, and not really a metaphysically coherent concept of liberty. True
freedom as the perfected flourishing of one’s being is an eschatological
fruition that can be anticipated insofar as one’s actions bring one closer to
the unique gift of one’s being/vocation granted by the creator God.

To our list of Orthodox universalist authors, I would like to add Fr.
Alexandre Turnicev, who wrote Alexandre Turincev (1966) “Une approche de
l’eschatologie orthodoxe,” Contacts 18, no. 54. The article also appeared in
part in Olivier Clément, ‘Dieu est Vivant: catéchisme pour les familles par
une équipe de Chrétiens Orthodoxes’ (Editions du Cerf, 1979), which was the
original French edition of ‘The Living God: A Catechism for the Christian
Faith’, 2 Vols. Trans. by Olga  
Dunlop (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1988) but that chapter was omitted in
the English  
translation. So Father Michael Gillis and the monks from Holy Transfiguration
Hermitage (Gibsons, BC Canada) helped me translate it into English. You can
see it in the Canadian Journal of Orthodox Christianity here:
<http://www.cjoc.ca/pdf/Vol_9_1_1_Eschatology.pdf>

But I cannot put dismiss Sergius Bulgakov’s suggestion that it is the world
that allows Satan to entertain his delusion that God is not his true good. But
eventually he will be expelled from the world and deprived of the world. He
will no longer have the world to “feed” on. At this point “Satan’s duel with
God begins,” Bulgavkov writes. “Can we, human beings, know anything about this
duel?”

Before a person can seriously entertain the universalist hope, he must become
per­suaded that the the Father of Jesus Christ loves sinners absolutely,
uncondi­tion­ally, nontransactionally. I can think of no better theologian to
assist us in grasping this truth than Robert Capon—not because Capon is a
theologian of the first-rank (he doesn’t even belong to the second-rank), but
because he has an uncanny ability to think outside the conditionalist box.
Such an ability is necessary when interpreting the New Testament as
eschatological discourse. Capon also has a whimsical writing style that often
makes me chuckle (and sometimes cringe).

Not that I would care if it did. That very imperial “ecumenical ” council is
an embarrassment in Christian history, and I sometimes think it a mercy that
such a hash was made of its promulgation that we literally do not know what
was truly determined there. For my money, if Origen was not a saint and church
father, then no one has any claim to those titles. And the contrary claims
made by a brutish imbecile Emperor are of no consequence.

My question (possibly related to your comment above on the gnomic will and its
ultimate indistinction from the natural will) has to do with created agency as
fulfilled in Christ and enjoying a ‘scope of loving possibilities’ within
which to freely/creatively determine how it shall reflect divine beauties.
Going with Certeau’s suggestion, might we imagine the logoi of created beings
as embodying or specifying a “range” or “scope” (a pallet?) of beautiful
expression and not the particular of every form? The divine will (or logoi)
would terminate not in the final form of creaturely expression but in the
range of creative possibilities offered to creatures to uniquely shape their
expressive form (unique not in the creation of beauties not already comprised
in Christ as the summum bonum, but simply as the creature’s contribution to
the consummate beauty of ends synergistically achieved). Would the gnomic will
retain a unique function in this case?

Dale, you may find my multi-article review of Tom Talbott’s book _The
Inescapable Love of God_ of interest. Several of these articles address New
Testament texts. The results are often surprising. And the comment threads are
quite interesting, too! <https://goo.gl/BrsRp9>

Brad’s book is perhaps the best book on hell that I have read

On p. 320, with reference to Michel de Certeau’s “Authorités Chrétiennes et
Structures Sociales,” you concede the possibility that in our final fulfilled
form Christ offers (in Certeau’s words) “a style of existence that ‘allows’
for a certain kind of creativity and that opens a new series of experiences”
as opposed to, say, Christ specifying every particular of our continuing
existence without remainder (even if, as you say, Christ comprises the
fullness of every contingent expression).

Ah, yes, I like this:  
“Perhaps God pursue us ‘as long as it takes’?”  
For many decades I have inclined toward a universalist view, pretty much since
reading Hosea Ballou’s “Ancient History of Universalism” (a mid-19th century
volume that I still have, buried somewhere in my library). “Inclined” as I do
not believe there is adequate conclusive evidence, either in Scripture or
Tradition, that any of us are qualified to claim knowledge of what is the
reality of “the other side”. I do believe in Hell, but I don’t know what I
believe about it. I do believe in the possibility of a permanent rejection of
God, but find it very difficult to believe that anyone (even including him
that once was Lucifer) can hold out against increasing knowledge through all
eternity,  
and I have become convinced that something resembling Purgatory has a far
greater likelihood than does an eternal hell. God’s mercy is infinite, He
desireth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should live. All that
being said, the operative thought is that we simply cannot know, not having
been conclusively told, but that we can certainly trust and hope in that
boundless mercy. It is not so much what we do with our free will, but what
Jesus has done on the Cross that matters. If He has declared us saved, so we
are, but if our flawed and twisted will has not accepted that, perhaps his
call and his teaching will ultimately bring us to a place of healing. There is
time enough and more. Perhaps it’s like what my Dad always said about how he
came to be married: “She kept on chasing me … until I caught her.”  
cf. Francis Thomson’s. “Hound of Heaven”>

I take it the first just means the will is empowered by God (given God’s
purposes for its final end, mind you) to say ‘no’ (as well as ‘yes’) to
embracing God as its final end. I’m not sure what you mean by the second
claim. If you mean only that the will can never finally rest in anything other
than God, that God is the only thing it can finally convert to, then yes. But
if you mean that under the right circumstances (say, final judgment) our God-
given power to say ‘no’ can be converted irrespective of its exercise as a
power to interrupt itself, then I’m inclined to disagree…

Eric C.: I think that even among those who believe in libertarian free will
(no determinism), many, perhaps most, still believe that God can foreknow what
we will freely do (even if God can’t cause us to do what we do, if we’re to be
free). If you think universalism is revealed in inspired scripture, you
needn’t buy into determinism, but just divine foreknowledge.  
(Actually for me, that doesn’t help, because I’m among the minority who think
God cannot even foreknow, at least with absolute certainty, what we will
freely do. But I still count myself a universalist. I think that so long as
you accept that it’s overwhelmingly probable that all will be saved, you
should count. I also have another scheme by which the salvation of all might
be absolutely certain, but won’t go into that here.)

Andrew Louth is a patristic scholar and one of the foremost Orthodox
theologians in the world. Louth grounds Orthodox reflection on the Last Things
in the Divine Liturgy. Louth notes that “in Orthodox theology a hope of
universal salvation, based on a conviction of the boundlessness of God’s love,
has never gone away.”

But no one denies free will. Everything here is an affirmation of it. It is
the “voluntarist” view of freedom, paradoxically, that would make the will
incapable of freedom. Do you, as a Christian, believe you are free just
because you make choices, or that you are ever freer the better the choices
you make are? Because they correspond to the truth that is God, I mean?
Forgive me, but you simply need to think the matter through with greater
attention to the logic of freedom and the logic of what metaphysical and modal
attributes are entailed in the word “God.” No Church Father ever had a keener
and fuller and more sophisticated understanding of free will than did Gregory
of Nyssa. None was a more adamant and unhesitating universalist. The two
things are not in tension in his thought; they are necessarily logically
implied in one another.

However, saying, “I alone will perish” is not a Universalist statement. Are
there other statements that he made suggesting that he was a Universalist?

Desmond is a friend of mine, incidentally, and I do not know if I have ever
found cause to disagree with him on anything.

Even if there is no such thing as efficacious grace by which God can
unilaterally convert the wicked, philosopher Eric Reitan argues that their
salvation is statistically certain, as long as God continues to offer his
forgiveness after death.

I’m not a trained philosopher (which you know by now), and if the Analytic
tradition inherently violates some law of transcendence, then OK. Obviously
that tradition has been employed to deny transcendence. But analytic thinkers
can employ the standard categories to affirm transcendence as well, no? (Denys
Turner perhaps?) But, as far your comments in the quote go, it looks to me
like you employ the categories you want equally to dismiss—i.e., all things
are “determined” to a “final cause,” “rational nature” can interrupt itself,
and “teleology” drives the process. Are not these terms standard analytic-
talk?

DeRose asks the free-will defenders of hell: if God cannot save all, why at
least does he not save more than he does? DeRose distinguishes himself from
David Hart in that he cannot affirm that all, without exception, will
indubitably be saved; but he thinks it very, very, very likely.

“The moral conscience may accept hell, understood in the sense of a state of
purification of the soul – lasting, perhaps, but not perpetual. But here is
what matters: hell can be vanquished, and it is already vanquished. This is
the central affirmation of our Faith. To believe in Christ is to believe in
His victory over hell. He is the vanquisher of death and of hell. He is our
Deliverer. He alone can liberate us from hell, even now or in the next life.
It should be added that the Orthodox Church disregards the Latin distinction
of hell and purgatory. She prays for all the dead and does not accept that
there are any who are already damned forever. The existence beyond the grave
is nothing but the continuation of the deceased’s destiny, with its
progressive purifying and liberating action – a healing, a maturation and a
creative expectation.”

True. But which of my books, I ask myself, do you mean? Buy them all, I say.

As long as the subject of Dr Hart’s fiction has come up, I’d like to express
how truly outstanding that collection is.

This article is one of a series on the eschatology of Sergius Bulgakov. He
contends that in the final judgment, all will see the risen Christ and in
their hearts will know the One in whose image they were made and know, by
comparison, how far they have fallen from the Image. “It is impossible,”
declares Bulgakov, to appear before Christ and to see Him without loving him.”

Pass me a pint gentlemen! Brian, very helpful. Thank you. I’ll look up William
D as well.

Since its publication in 1899, this book has been the standard historical work
on the universalist sympathies of the Church Fathers. Its scholarship is
dated—it should be read alongside Ramelli’s _The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis_ —but it remains a useful resource. An online version can be
found at [Tentmaker.org](https://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html).

This is a classic in Roman Catholic literature on the subject. Here we see the
decisive break in post-Vatican II Catholicism from retributivist models of
both purgatory and hell.

Gustave Martelet “Hell,” Encyclopedia of Christian Theology, Vol. 1, edited by
Jean-Yves Lacoste, (New York: Routledge, 2005), 693.

“Simply said, all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will
reach that end, and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption
prevents them; but rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still,
willy-nilly, all natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as
bliss or torment, but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot
not convert the will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will
never be all in all and creation will never be completed. That teleological
understanding of the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be
forced into the categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I
honestly wish Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories
for that reason.”

At the end of his life, the notable Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson came
to affirm universal salvation. For those acquainted with his theology, this
was not a surprise. The entirety of his project inevitably points to this
conclusion.

Now, if God were to say, “My dear Yaakov, no matter what you do or desire,
even against your strongest wish, I will turn your heart to me” – then I’d say
that statement would be more of a turn off than “only you will perish and
there’s nothing I can do to save you”.

Is the “freedom” to sell yourself into slavery or lock yourself in a cage
actual freedom? It seems more like a limitation of the will to me.

– On the one hand, “rational nature is capable of interrupting itself” of
preventing its movement toward its natural end in God.

I am truly gratified you think well of my writing. Certainly, I would welcome
a venue to share my thoughts.

Fear not. Fr John is wrong–absolutely and lamentably wrong. God actually is
better than we, not the contemptible tyrant of the servile religious
imagination. Read Isaac. Read George MacDonald’s Unspoken Sermons, the finest
works of theology in the English language.

You mentioned the toll houses, a curious bit of semi-gnostic bric-a-brac. Fr
John might be interested to know that many monks who embraced that teaching
did so because they were universalists.

I think I’m tracking with you … so might we say that the showing and seeing is
what heals (rather than coerces) the gnomic will such that neither God’s self-
revelation nor our natural response (of both nous in seeing and will in
following) can be charged with voluntarism?

What a delight to see David Bentley Hart’s thoughts. My own notes were that
two of the texts commonly viewed as signalling eternal punishment were based
on mis-readings by St. Augustine: namely the Romans 5:18, and the I
Corinthians 15:22, as suggested to me by David. I added the specific
references from St. Augustine’s Epistles, and his Contra Jul., again having
pointed in those directions by David. I hope I have the transliterated Greek
accurate.

Sebastian Brock is one of the foremost scholars in the world on Syriac
Christianity. This essay is particularly valuable for the copious quotations
from St Isaac on the theme of apokatastasis. If you are unable to purchase the

(in which his eschatological homilies are contained), then you definitely want
to read this paper.

Oh, I forgot, he quotes a bad translation of Gregory’s De infantibus too. Fr
John, read the Greek, in the Gregorii Nysseni Opera of Jaeger et al. On Cyril
and Athanasius, the arguments of various scholars on ther “disposition” is a
subtle but fascinating one, and Ramelli is actually quite good on that.

But in any case, if we take Saul of Tarsus as an example, when Christ appeared
to him, was he coerced into salvation by the will of God? I don’t think so. Or
did he himself choose or will his response to Christ? I don’t think so. I just
don’t see ‘will’ being the primary faculty involved. Rather, he ‘saw’ and then
*naturally* repented and believed. His ‘nous’ was enlightened which then
activated his natural will. If there is anything to this, then what great hope
we might derive from the promise, ‘And every eye I shall see him’ … after
which ‘and every knee shall bow’ would make perfect sense.

Right. There’s no value in ignorance per se. I’m only suggesting that the
‘becoming’ of human beings toward their final telos in God be characterized by
choosing which is a choice between alternatives, and not a single inevitable
choice given to them by God (which, I confess, is how I read some construals
of universalism). Does that help at all?

Of course, one can then get into the old wrangles between Thomists and
Scotists over the priority of intellect or will in knowing God. And the
Scotists are routinely misrepresented in that regard, since for them intellect
is not the same as reason and will is not the same as spontaneous arbitrium;
both are rational movements of the soul. And really, after all, both are
really one and the same movement; they are not genuinely separable faculties.
Intellect is informed because it is intentional, and therefore has a natural
velleity towards the world and towards the transcendental horizon of truth.
Will is a rational movement towards a perceived end, and therefore naturally
follows (as best it can) the light of intellect. There really is no need here
to assign priority: the final end is a kingdom of love and knowledge, the two
proving to be infinitely identical

Even so, I still cannot grant the liceity of the way you formulate freedom.
Part of it is that there is a difference between being “informed” in the
modern sense (possessing “information” and then, in a second movement of
deliberation, deciding upon it based upon some distinct set of criteria) and
being truly “in-formed” in the classical sense of being reshaped by the glory
of God. God is not a species of cognitive information in the former sense,
some finite object available to my judicious gaze. To know God is to be
transfigured into what is revealed. At that point of truest liberty, freedom
and necessity are no longer distinguished, any more than they are in the
Father’s own love of his own essence in the Son and Spirit. Remember, the only
thing to which Paul says we are predestined (well, marked out for in advance,
really) is to be conformed to the image of Christ. No less austerely apophatic
thinker than Maximus says that we achieve freedom (and are perfect as Christ’s
Father is perfect) when all distance (diastema) disappears and we rush into
the embrace of love.

Guinness it is. My treat. I’m not a fan of beer though. A chilled Pinot Grigio
will do, if David Hart will join.

Yes, you, John Milbank, William Desmond.  
When I’m in the mood for a little light reading . . .

A different kind of devil altogether. If you like “The House of Apollo,”
incidentally, by that alone you can gain entrance to paradise–without even
having to go through the Tollhouses.

For a philosophical argument based on a libertarian understanding of free
will, see “[What Are the
Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-salvation-what-are-
the-odds/)”

The universalist views of Origen and St Gregory Nyssen are well known, but
what about St Maximus the Confessor. Andreapoulos believes that strands of
Maximus’s eschatology intimate an openness to the universalist vision, despite
the damnation passages that can be found in the Maximian corpus. Andreapoulos
points to Maximus’s conviction that every human being will experience an
eschatological healing of his gnomic will. When the Good is fully manifested
in the _parousia_ of Christ, why would anyone reject the Good?

Seriously, though, when Brian writes: “I maintain that the original gift of
being involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some
level, but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream,
play, wonder, creativity and loving encounter,” it is rather as if I am
reading someone else laying out my own sensibility. But I think there is a
deep theological insight here that is too easily ignored as something vague,
gauzy, or sentimental, because we are all so prone to thinking in the rather
arid categories of (for want of a better word) analytic correspondence that we
regard the entire tacit dimension of knowledge (which is the foundation of all
knowledge) as somehow either merely inchoate or merely emotional. If one is
not careful, one ends up with the barren dialectic of “rationalism” or
“fideism,” and one ends up like a certain popular Thomist I know of, unable to
think in any other terms than that.

By the way, the picture of free will advanced here is essentially that of
Maximus the Confessor.

Balthasar is well known for his advocacy of a non-necessary universalist hope:
we may and should hope that God will save all, but we must not presume that he
will. Wood finds Balthasar’s position unsatisfactory and commends as an
alternative the bold and confident hope of George MacDonald.

2) If it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s gift throughout their
whole life in this world, why is it not possible for a human person to
continue to do so after he or she has has died? I suppose, ultimately, I don’t
understand why, if it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s offer
once, it is not possible for them to refuse it on and on for the rest of their
existence. I don’t in anyway think that people must do that. I don’t see why
it’s not a possibility though.

Good points too. I certainly don’t want to boil theosis down to an exchange of
bits of information. So I’ll work on fine-tuning the distinction I’m aiming at
here. My gut tells me there’s a legit (liceitous? Adjective please?) concern
about created agency here (that it not be overwhelmed unto determinism). But
as I’m reading you, you’re not simply positing in a postmortem context the
kind of, say, compatibilist determination of human choice you reject
presently, supposing that God resorts to perfecting human beings postmortem in
a fundamentally different way than at present.

Andreano explores what Origen really taught about the eternal destiny of
Satan. Some fascinating material here. After you’ve read this, read Bulgakov’s
essay “On the Question of the Apocatastasis of the Fallen Spirits.” Makes for
an interesting comparison.

George MacDonald’s sermon “Love Thy Neighbour” has a passage so reminiscent of
Silouan’s remark that it is almost difficult to keep them distinct in one’s
memory.

God can guarantee the conversion of the wicked by bestowing upon them a
perfect vision of himself as the Good.

As a former Protestant, I can testify to the radical difference (at least
existentially) between living in the cacophony of the confessions, which
distinguished and perpetrated divisions and prescribed bounded sets as to what
we had to believe (including infernalism) … vis-a-vis my Orthodox experience
of the creeds as centered sets around which we unify, which also limit what we
may impose on others and allow for a freedom of theological thought and
discourse (that I see here).

First, note that what is being rejected in those two anathemas is not
universalism. The first rejects pre-existence of souls without bodies, in a
primal and undifferentiated community of monads. The second rejects an
ultimate disappearance both of bodies and of individual identity in a unity
rather of the sort asserted by bar Sudhaili, where gnosis (the single shared
knowledge of God and souls) is indistinguishable from the hypostasis (the
substance) of souls. Neither was a teaching of Origen’s, actually (Origen
taught pre-existence, but not actual bodilessness).

Much of Walls’s philosophical career has been devoted to matters
eschatological. In this 2015 book he pulls together his reflections for a
popular audience. It is clearly written, accessible, and affordable—highly
recommended. Also see my [multi-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/jerry-walls-heaven-hell-and-
purgatory/). For more in-depth treatment, read Walls scholarly trinity
(below).

Bulgakov’s is the most profound vision of the greater hope that I have read.

The Apostle Peter teaches that after his death, the Lord descended into hades
and preached the good news to the departed. In her hymnody the Eastern Church
sings that the result of this harrowing was the rescue of all.

Here is my book-length treatment of the subject: [The Biblical Case for
Everyone Going to Heaven](http://wp.me/PNthc-i6)

Do you enjoy analytic philosophical reflection on the hell? You’ll find a
number of interesting essays in this volume, including a piece by Talbott on
free will and character formation and a piece by Jerry Walls on
annihilationism. Check out the table of contents on the Amazon page.

Bulgakov was perhaps the most creative, daring, profound—and also most
contro­versial—Orthodox theologian of the 20th century. Those of us who are
unacquainted with Russian philosophy, as I am, will probably find this a
difficult book to read; yet it is illuminating in ways that most works of
theology are not. Bulgakov’s mind and heart were alive with the Holy Spirit.
He was a true priest and theologian of the Church.

Also, let me confess that I am not well-read in universalism, so my responses
can’t be entirely fair to y’all as I’m not working from a lot of the common
source material. That being said, I find this conversation very interesting
and will continue to read up on the question.

Will read that sermon between chapters of the Devil and Pierre! I like the
subtle threat of hell to those alone who would use it to terrorize — no need
for iron in paradise — the kind of rhetorical reversal we see in Christ’s
parables.

Simply said, if it isn’t one of the promulgations of the seven councils, then
it’s nothing but the record of how certain clergymen at a certain time and
place understood the tradition (usually over against those blasted monks). And
then there is the question of what certain councils–the 5th of course–really
said.

Written a decade after his _Theandros_ essay, and taking into account more
recent scholarship, Andreapoulos elaborates on the eschatological perspectives
of St Maximus. As in his earlier essay, he believes that the logic of
Maximus’s ontological and anthropological reflections leave open the
possibility of universal salvation. Regarding apokatastasis Andreapoulos
concludes:

Have you come across “All Shall Be Well – Explorations in Universal Salvation
and Christian Theology from Origen to Moltmann” edited by (you-know-who)
Gregory MacDonald?  
Among others it contains Origen (obviously), Schleiermacher, P. T. Forsyth,
Barth, Ellul, T  
Robinson, Balthasar and Moltmann. It is an excellent addition to your already
excellent list.

In simple terms, if a deranged man chooses to slash himself with a knife or
set fire to himself, you would not be interfering with his “freedom” by
preventing him from doing so. You would be rescuing him from his slavery to
madness. This is why the free-will defense of the idea of an eternal hell is
essentially gibberish.

A brilliant exposition of the critical assertion in Sergius Bulgakov’s
universalist eschatology that at the Second Coming all will love Christ.

I would see a distinction between the hopeful inclusivism of Ware and
Balthasar and the ultimate redemption of which Gregory (and Macrina) were so
confident. It seems to me that there are two types of hopeful inclusivism that
stop short of Gregory. First, those like Ware and Balthasar who insist on the
possibility (in principle, even if ‘infinitely improbable’) that some might,
in the end, resist divine love because of ‘free will.’ Another version,
somewhat softer, and perhaps in both Origen and Barth, that might say, ‘We
believe is as mystery, but cannot teach it as doctrine,’

Universal salvation is the only “tolerable” answer to evil and suffering in
the world.

Both of these fly in the face of the faith delivered once and for all that
says that a baptized human person has free will now, *AND* will have free will
in the eschaton.

Dale,  
Those two verses are actually universalist verses. Augustine’s curious
treatment of them was frequently to quote the first half of each (affirming
the universality of the Fall) but almost never the second (affirming the
universality of redemption).  
David

William Lane Craig has sought to rebut the claim that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if there is a hell by suggesting that they will be so
enraptured by their vision of God that they will not give the damned a second
thought. But how is this not a failure to love?

David, may I ask for your thoughts about the dogmatic authority with Orthodoxy
of the [Synodikon](https://sites.google.com/site/thetaboriclight/synodikon).
It is sometimes invoked as a decisive authority against the universalist hope.
This anathema in particular is cited:

I have not read this book yet, but Tom Belt assures us that it is an excellent
primer on the topic of universal salvation. See [Tom’s EO
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/grace-saves-all-a-book-
review/).

The Synodikon is just a compendium, and at times a converses, and possesses
only as much authority as what it is quoting at any point. In itself it is no
more binding on the conscience of an Orthodox than the Baltimore Catechism or
a Thomist manual is on the conscience of a Catholic.

“Rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in a
kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny.”

To be honest, the rhetoric is stirring, but I find the reasoning a little
banal, for the reasons I have already enunciated. And exegetically poor. It
reduces freedom to mere libertarian optionalism (to use some jargon) and God
to an option among options (a thing among things). It is a defense of an
indefensible doctrinal tradition, heroic but hopeless.

“When once to a man the human face is the human face divine, and the hand of
his neighbor is the hand of a brother, then will he understand what St. Paul
meant when he said, “I wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren.” But he will no longer understand those who, so far from feeling the
love of their neighbor an essential of their being, expect to be set free from
its law in the world to come. There, at least, for the glory of God, they may
limit its expansive tendencies to the narrow circle of their heaven. On its
battlements of safety, they will regard hell from afar, and say to each other,
“Hark! Listen to their moans. But do not weep, for they are our neighbors no
more.”

From what I have read, I personally would not describe either [St
Silouan](http://www.bogoslov.ru/en/text/2314168.html) or Elder Sophrony as
explicit universalists; rather, they appear to leave open the possibility of
universal salvation.

The New Testament only seems to clearly teach eternal damnation if it is read
through a hermeneutic of perdition. Its witness looks very different when read
through the paschal victory of Jesus Christ.

Section III of _Bride of the Lamb_ is devoted to the topic of eschatology.
This section can be read to great benefit just by itself. Bulgakov’s
universalism is neither sentimental nor trite. He does not envision salvation
apart from repentance and ascetical sacrifice. We should fear hell and its
torment, but we should trust God more. “The torments of hell are a longing for
God caused by the love of God,” he states. It is blasphemy to think that evil
will triumph over the the risen Lord. Bulgakov emphatically rejects any
violation of the human person. No one can or should be coerced into the
kingdom. The divine judgment is nothing less than the full revelation of the
Christ, in whose image every human being is made: “Every human being sees
himself in Christ and measures the extent of his difference from this proto-
image. A human being cannot fail to love the Christ who is revealed in him,
and he cannot fail to love himself revealed in Christ.” (See Roberto de la
Noval’s article on Bulgakov, listed below.)

Talbott was asked to write a new essay for the online Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. This article provides a helpful review of recent philosophical
discussion of hell. Talbott does not hide his universalist sympathies. For a
different perspective, see [the article by Jonathan
Kvanvig](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/heaven-hell/) that
Talbott’s piece replaced.

Too long a question. I think I have been pretty clear in saying that the
conversion in question is necessarily a conversion of the will through its own
free (and progressively freer) act. Even the will’s power to say no, however,
is animated by its primordial hunger for the Good and, as Gregory and others
argue, to that it cannot say no, except by ceasing to exist. That is the act
of all its acts. So, in time, over the ages perhaps, it continues to seek its
rest in God, freely but, for that reason, inevitably.

Origen did NOT invent the doctrine of universal salvation. Going back to the
second century there existed a position that may be described as “intercessory
universalism.”

Brad, I presume that “holy monk of Mt. Athos” who is quoted is St. Silouan?
Thanks. I needed to read that after reading Fr. John’s posts on this subject.
It is that precise agony of prayer in my own experience, a deep grief that any
should miss Christ and be lost, that I believe prompted the Lord in His mercy
to open my eyes to the Orthodox Church. Without at least a hope that all might
be saved–without a genuinely Orthodox Paschal vision–I don’t see how I would
be able to go on getting up again after I fall down in my walk with Christ. I
live in dread that Fr. John’s interpretation of the Tradition of the Church
might be correct. This fallen world is already more a hell to me than I can
handle–watching cultures coarsen, crash and burn, knowing how people suffer
and being mostly powerless to help any of them. St. Silouan’s vision is the
prayer that keeps me going.

I know that Maximus often speaks of the gnomic will as simply the sinful and
deviating will. Something tells me–more a phenomenology of consciousness than
a moral metaphysics–that it might be better to think of it as the “third
moment” of the conscious act, so to speak, the first two being the primordial
intention of the natural will and the power of intellect (both being
rational). Then the gnomic will is that supremely rational moment of (ideally)
assent or love or creative liberty that completes the “trinitarian” movement
of the mind and makes it genuinely rationally free.

Faced with the lights of the Kingdom of heaven in the night (in itself
hopeless) of hell, we are therefore empowered by faith to throw ourselves
naked into the love of God. As worthy descendants of Abraham—“In hope he
believed against hope” (Rom 4:18)—we hope that the bottomless depths of God’s
fatherhood, of Christ’s Passion, and of the resources of the Holy Spirit will
allow us to escape from the fiery prison that is hell. We can say nothing of
how this might be; but we must trust absolutely in the reserves of love,
grace, and glory, whose only measure is God’s love for the Son in the Holy
Spirit, a love in which we are forever included. Moreover, since God has
revealed to us in his Son that we are saved and saveable by pure grace, and
never by our works (Rom 1–4), how could it be otherwise when the eschatology
of every creature is decided, at the crowning moment when the mystery of
grace, in which we have been established for all time by God himself, will be
fulfilled? In this light, hell becomes, with regard to a boundless faith, the
location of choice for God’s victory over the most incomprehensible
rejection—victory that could be called humanly unexpected and that is for the
prayer of the spiritual and for the thought of the theologian “able to be
hoped for.”

A helpful introduction to universalist reflection in the patristic Church,
with special focus on Origen, St Gregory of Nazianzus, and St Gregory of
Nyssa.

There is also a Russian and a Greek parish in the Princeton area, but they
have very few converts.

Regarding your series on St Isaac, which was englightening, I don’t see where
it shows that the two ideas are separated. You do say that St. Isaac doesn’t
go into God’s method for effecting everyone’s eventual choosing of Him, but
that doesn’t rule out pre-destination.

A courageous essay by a Polish Catholic theologian. Hryniewicz directly
challenges centuries of the pedagogy of fear. The section “Is God Helpless in
the Face of the Gift of Freedom?” is particularly illuminating. “God himself
is the greatest hope for all His creatures,” Hryniewicz writes. “He penetrates
even the infernal depths of the human heart. He can lead out of the depths of
Gehenna. He does not destroy the freedom of rational beings, but respects
human choice. However, he has his truly divine way of persuading the freedom
of the beings most in revolt. He attracts and transforms them from the inside
through His goodness, beauty and boundless love manifested above all in the
voluntary kenosis of Christ.”

This six-article series on St Isaac the Syrian might be considered as a
systematic mini-presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, concluding in the
eschatological reconciliation of sinful humanity and fallen angels with their
eternal Creator. Please read the series in order. But if are too impatient to
read the entire series, I give you permission to skip to the end: “[The
Triumph of the Kingdom Over
Gehenna](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/23/the-triumph-of-the-kingdom-
over-gehenna/)” and “[The Demonic Void and the Apokatastasis of
Satan](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/30/the-demonic-void-and-the-
apokatastasis-of-satan/).”

David’s article in First Things on Augustine’s misread of Rom. 9-11 was
especially helpful.

As it happens, the next work of technical theology I plan to write is on
precisely that topic. Unfortunately, I have been very ill these past 15
months, so I do not know when or if I shall write it. But my translation, I
hope, will come to be thought of as The Apokatastatic Standard Version.

Are you sure that you’re not my secret Doppelgaenger, and that soon I’m going
to wake up and realize I’m not I at all but someone you dreamed (in a
Guinness-induced delirium)? I’m pleased you had the wisdom to avoid the
academic world once you got doctored, but I would like to know what you do,
where you are, and whether you write anywhere. And, if not, there’s a journal
I’m associated with…

Morwenna Ludlow, _[Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory
of Nyssa and Karl
Rahner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199566968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99566968&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20)_

I confess I do press hard, but only to see how much is discoverable; to test-
drive theories. But I’d be happy with the mere affirmation THAT our actions
contribute (in ways that do not reduce to mere secondary causation). If that’s
affirmed, I can tolerate any amount of mystery.

Capon described the writing of this book a “watershed experience” and
considered it his most important book. It’s difficult to describe. The first
part is a parable of two adulterous lovers, Paul and Laura, with Caponic
commentary. Many will find the parable scandalous, because the two lovers do
not repent of their sin. Capon, of course, is not endorsing sin (despite
appearances, he is not an antinomian); but he wants us to see that
unconditional love (represented by Laura) transcends moralism. The second part
is an imaginary coffee house Q&A between Capon and his parish­ioners. The
third part is another parable—this time a parable about the gangster-style
execution of a New Jersey mobster. Is it possible for God to forgive murder,
redeem murder? Yes, Capon boldly asserts. Evil is eternally enveloped, judged,
and redeemed within the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Anyway, let Fr John believe as he believes. I have encountered that sort of
Orthodox or Catholic before. They are often the most vigorous in good works
too (being far nicer, it seems, than the God their theology describes).

Which, incidentally, does not break from the “synergist” view. It is merely to
say that the cooperation of the created will with God’s is still a
cooperation–if needs be by terrible purgation–in restoring a human soul to its
natural state. I think of Gregory of Nyssa deals with this quite delightfully
and cogently in De anima et resurrectione.

Analytic philosophy does not own words like “determined,” incidentally. My
problem is specifically with the current analytic categories of determinism,
compatibilism, libertarian freedom, etc., because they all presume an
originally voluntarist understanding of free will, which is simply incoherent.
When I use “determined” in that sentence, I am just speaking of final
causality, primary causality.

What to do? Can we bring your two phrases together in supposing that it is the
very power to interrupt which must embrace God as its end? God saves ‘that’
power, i.e., our will in its God-given power to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. And it
rests when, as a God-given power to interrupt itself, it gives itself to God.
Maybe that’s your position. Sorry if I’ve misunderstood. But that does look
minimally libertarian to me (not a crude claim to a power to self-determine
free from all context and natural constraints).

Following Louth’s lead, it seems like early Maximos assigns a gnomic will to
Christ (since, if we have one, Christ must have a gnomic will, lest what is
not assumed is not healed) and then later, denies it (because he sees it as a
dysfunction). But in positing the gnomic will as a ‘third moment,’ you not
only take the conversation a good leap forward, but also open up our
imaginations to revisit Gethsemane, where ‘Not my will, but thine,’ reveals
that third moment in Christ. Non? Oui?

_I will update this list as I continue to read on this subject._

Gavrilyuk offers a helpful introduction to Bulgakov’s eschatology. He is
ultimately critical of Bulgakov’s universalist convictions: he thinks that the
great theologian slides into a metaphysical necessitarianism, just as Origen
did. I disagree. Bulgakov is too concerned to preserve the synergistic freedom
of the creature to allow any kind of necessity to govern his eschatological
convictions.

Man was not created perfect. Man was created innocent and according to
Gregory, I think, as moral toddlers. This makes the fall inevitable and
therefore, mercy is ultimately God’s only just response. (riffing off Dr
Andrew Klager, an Orthodox universalist). Perfection is the telos of theosis
rather than the first state.

The figure of Judas Iscariot has long captured the imagination of Christians,
even begetting poems and songs. Hart reflects on one forgotten poem by a
forgotten English poet, Robert Buchanan. If Jesus is love, is he not awaiting
the return of his friend and disciple at the messianic banquet?

Thanks for the recommendation on Sergius Bulgakov from this blog. He looks
pretty clean as well.

My wife and I will be moving there in September for her postdoc. I’ve
contacted the local Orthodox parish here in Doha (and the Archbishop in a
chance encounter; he deflected my inquiry) in order to begin conversion to
Orthodoxy, but it has been of no avail. Anyway, my wife and I will be
travelling throughout the region and coordinating our move back to the States
this summer so I will unfortunately not be able to begin the initiation (that
is, if it resembles the duration of RCIA) until we’re settled in Princeton. In
light of Fr. John discouraging universal salvation, I’m hesitant to explain to
an unsympathetic priest that it is largely St. Isaac’s writings on the
atonement and our ultimate reconciliation with God that has drawn me to the
Church. Can you recommend a parish in Princeton where that will not
automatically exclude me from entering the Church?

A collection of essays discussing the universalist hope articulated by various
theologians in the history of the Church, from Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa
to Sergius Bulgakov, and Karl Barth. Tom Talbott’s piece on George MacDonald
is of particular interest. A helpful and instructive volume.

A very interesting discussion…On reading the posts, some quite technical and
others quite poetic and evocative, I could not help but think of the need for
this type of conversation to be more broad in that such a topic has also been
addressed in other religious traditions. I think, for instance, of the
Buddhist tradition, ( Mahayana), of the Bodhisattvas who refuse entering total
enlightenment until all beings are also saved, enlightened.  
On ignorance and enlightenment, Dogen Zenji is quite adamant that
enlightenment occurs in the midst of ignorance. He upholds a paradoxical way,
one that I find challenging to our usual black/white, binary logic.  
At any rate, I find the discussion to have been, for me, quite fruitful and
encouraging. I hope the participants, all of them, find the goal they are
earnestly striving for.

Oh, by the way, Capon was not a universalist. He believes that it is possible
for the sinner, like the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son, to
stand outside the festivities of the kingdom. Like C. S. Lewis, Capon
advocates a free-will model of damnation. Might it be possible for the damned
to repent of their rejection of the divine mercy? Perhaps. All moments in time
are eternally held within the spear wound of Christ and thus eternally
available to the damned for their exploration and reassessment.

This may be the first book I would recommend to someone who desires to explore
the biblical basis for the universalist hope. Written for a popular audience,
Jersak invites his readers to bracket their dogmatic systems and listen to the
Scriptures afresh, in all of their irreducible diversity and complexity. “Our
obsessive attempts,” he writes, “to harmonize the Scriptures into artificially
coherent, stackable propositions—as if they required us to contend for their
reliability or authority—actually do violence to their richness.” One finds
within the Bible specific texts that may be reasonably interpreted to support
each of the three major construals of eschatological destiny—infernalist,
annihilationist, and universalist. Perhaps we need to hear all three voices.

Thanks for this list Fr. Aidan. I am firmly into the concept that Met. Ware
has expressed. I hope for the salvation of all mankind. However, I believe
that Satan and the demons have already been judged and condemned to
annihilation in the Lake of Fire which is prepared for them. God has waited to
carry out their execution because he wants to save all humanity if possible.
The Church Fathers who believed that Satan and the demons would be saved have
no basis in Holy Scripture and the acts of Satan and the demons to base their
teaching on. Where there is no repentance, there is not life.

Come to think of it, even the priests I know who reject universalism have
still been very welcoming. For instance, my priest back home (I’m from the
Northwest U.S.) was a fan of Fr. John, but he never saw my inclination towards
universalism as something that should exclude me.

What are the conditions of rational freedom, and does the choice to reject God
definitively fulfill them?

I now see that David responded to that in his comments above. Thank you.

It is generally assumed by Orthodox believers that the doctrine of everlasting
damnation enjoys the status of irreformable or infallible dogma. It is
therefore necessary to examine the nature of dogma and what it means, at least
for the Orthodox, to characterize a dogmatic statement as irreformable. As we
see in this article, matters are more complex than popularly taught,
especially when it comes to eschatological questions.

First read Brad Jersak’s article “[Apocatastatic
Hymnody](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/let-every-mortal-leap-for-
joy-apocatastatic-hymnody-in-orthodox-worship/)” and then follow up with this
article. In addition to noting the universalist-orientation of Orthodox
hymnody, Howell also discusses the Last Judgment hymns, often cited as
testimony for the everlasting damnation position. His conclusion: when we
read, hear, and sing the hymns of the Orthodox Church, “we realize that the
universalist hope never did disappear” in the life of the Church.

Wonderful article and comments. Mr Hart, I’ve ordered your book. One thing I’d
like to add: the idea of ignorance vs knowledge, the force of the final [or
not] ‘No’: this is not always or only ignorance, but pathology. No one
violates free will by healing; the Gospel accounts of, eg, the demoniacs or
paralytics stand for this principle. If a man be healed of the
mental/spiritual pathology that lead him to ‘no’, surely he will say Yes. This
avoids the trap of loss of epistemic distance, I think, because you can posit
resistance to everything except the final force majeure.

For the past century the two principal models of eternal damnation have been
the retributivist and free will. Manis now introduces a third which he
believes expresses the best of both approaches—the divine presence model: God
eternally and only intends the salvation of every human being, but human
beings remain free to definitively reject his gracious gift. “The eternal
suffering of hell,” Manis contends, “is not the result of any divine act that
aims to inflict it, but rather the way that a sinful creature necessarily
experiences the unmitigated presence of a holy God.” Also see my [four-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/book-review-sinners-in-the-
presence-of-a-loving-god/) of the book.

This is a long-ranging article in which I respond to a piece by the Catholic
theologian and Balthasar expert Dr Larry Chapp. Following Balthasar, Chapp
confesses a hopeful, but non-necessary, universalism: God may save all, we
should pray that he will save all, but in the end he may not. What is this
“may not” but an admission that God may turn out not to be as good as we hoped
he would be?

This 3-article series represents a recently revised and expanded blog version
of the above Cardiff lecture. How does apokatastasis shape and inform our
preaching of the gospel? How does it fit in with the Orthodox understanding of
Church as manifestation of the Kingdom?

But let’s not pursue the issue. Be wrong in good conscience, and by that you
shall be saved.

I am recommending this book for its chapter on St Isaac’s eschatology. More
than a few Orthodox priests have whispered to me: “I am a universalist at
heart, but I can’t tell anyone. St Isaac convinced me.” Why the power of St
Isaac’s writings? Because he _knew_ the power and unconditionality of God’s
love–hence his confidence that God will eventually win over the heart and mind
of every human being and every demon.

As for how the fall occurred, no theologian has ever given a satisfactory
theory. But that word “perfect” is misplaced. By definition, nothing temporal
is “perfect” in its origin (unless by origin one means the divine intention
for that being).

With reference to C. S. Lewis’s _The Great Divorce_ , I reflect on the
possibility of heavenly happiness when one knows that one or more loved ones
are suffering everlasting torment.

I might say here that even hopeful inclusivists so far unable to dogmatize
this universal hope are nevertheless obligated by love to hope and pray for
it, to the degree that the supposed alternatives (infernalism, conditional
immortality or annihilationism) are in principle untenable.

And do you believe he really believed he was headed for eternal perdition? It
is a wonderful statement of humility and hope, not a prophecy.

Thomas Allin, D.D., lived at a time when it was not unusual for an Anglican
parish priest to also be an eminent scholar. He also lived at a time when a
growing number of British Protestants were challenging the received doctrine
of everlasting damnation. _Christ Triumphant_ is a classic work of this period
and is noteworthy for its presentation of the patristic witness to the larger
hope, as well as its strong theological case for the greater hope. Highly
recommended.

This discussion should go down in the annals of the blogosphere as the most
intellectually complex discussion ever to be pursued in the commentary section
of a blog. Thank you all very much!  
Unfortunately, I don’t have sufficient knowledge to participate in the
discussion. That is, I am too ignorant or, as most of you would probably put
it, I am too much lacking freedom.  
But perhaps that’s just because I’m catholic…

The 5th Ecumenical Council rejected universalism. Dare we think we know better
than the 5th Ecumenical Council? No.

_That All Shall Be Saved_ is profitably read alongside the metaphysical essays
contained in [_The Hidden and the
Manifest_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802865968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&camp89&creativeÂ25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN02865968&linkIdâa367c7766fadca06068c9bb6f10ccf),
especially “Impassibility as Transcendence.”

This recently published volume contains several essays by Bulgakov devoted to
eschatological and universalist themes. Many believe that this may be the best
introduction to Bulgakov’s theological vision.

1) Do you think it is possible for a human person to either accept or refuse
God’s gift of salvation in Christ?

Dr Parry’s contribution to this volume is one of the single best introductions
to universal salvation. Highly recommended.

To be clear, folks here are not granting your necessary condition. You’ve been
given various examples where what you stipulate does not properly apply.
Further, you continue to miss or ignore the provisional nature of the freedom
you assert. Fully realized freedom actually makes the kind of choice you posit
disappear in favor of perfect willing of the Good. You believe that imperfect
freedom of individuals as you posit it is dispositive for eternal destinies.
Universalists do not agree and they are not required by logic or metaphysical
necessity to do so. You’ve also been advised by some that the Person is
ultimately a gift of Christology and that relation is just as constitutive as
“substance.” Hence, it is incorrect to think the salvation of some and the
damnation of others as if one is dealing with atomized individuals. I’ve no
doubt, however, that you will continue to assert that universalists are
incoherent and that everyone is compelled to presume your view of freedom as
axiomatic.

In an article entitled “[The Incoherencies of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/),” recently published in _Church Life Journal_ (18 October
2022), James Dominic Rooney argues that universalism is a serious heresy that
Christians should clearly reject. He begins his article by men­tion­ing the
controversy over whether the Second Council of Constantinople (more generally
known as the Fifth Ecumenical Council of the Christian Church in 553) really
did condemn univer­sal­ism along with other doctrines, such as the pre-
existence of the soul. But con­cern­ing that controversy, he suggests that
even if “universalism might not have been condemned by that council,” this
would constitute “nothing more than an _interesting historical tidbit_ for
orthodox Christians.” I tend to agree with him here. For the con­tro­versy
over whether St. Paul himself delivered a universalist message and was
therefore a heretic, given Rooney’s view that such a message is itself
heretical, seems to me far more pertinent and far more important than the
controversy over the rulings of a single council. So if I may be forgiven an
extraneous remark here at the outset, I have yet to see a single cogent
argument against the claim that St. Paul was himself a universalist.1

5\. “Would you say that the God who cannot lie never tells the truth
freely?—and that he never freely acts in a just way?—and that he never freely
acts in a loving way toward his creatures?” I think these questions are
ambiguous. Clearly, God choosing to speak is a free action. But God is not
free to lie, as this is a result of His nature. So God does not freely choose
‘not to lie,’ which is one interpretation of ‘never tells the truth freely’.
The same applies to the rest. God is not free to choose ‘not to be loving,’
but He is free in His choice to love some creatures into being (with the
natures that they have), among all the other possible ones He could have
created, as well as in any subsequent commitments to act in a certain way
toward those creatures. God is free in terms of not being necessitated in
choice among the alternatives open to Him.

My normal response to these kind of inquiries is to largely stay out of them.
I write fiction and present through image and narrative an exploration of
reality. Readers are free to find it intriguing or not. The kind of dialogue
engaged here may point out aporias for further inquiry, but both sides
typically remained convinced of the rectitude of their existing opinions. And
so it is here. I think differently and make quite different conclusions.
Hence, I think it is entirely reasonable to expect ordinary use language to
have analogous purchase in theology. A voluntarist God who determines the good
by fiat, so that ostensibly it might be good to drown children or slug your
neighbor if they wear green is an irrational construct. It’s not persuasive to
assert that such actions might be good if we only knew more about God. The
apophatic check on cataphatic assertions about God is not a warrant to engage
in “theological nihilism” as David Hart terms such evasions. Thus, one may
licitly assert that God’s goodness transcends the limits of human
understanding, but that does not mean that the goodness of God could
conceivably be utterly counter to what we legitimately know about the Good. To
deny this, one must also deny reason and the capacity to make any
determination upon theology beyond a kind of fideist fundamentalism. Origen
said that when we read an assertion about God in the Old Testament that asks
us to believe that God would act in a manner one would find loathsome in a
human being, one should conclude that the literal is untrue because God’s
goodness surpasses our moral sense, not abrogates it.

In what universe are you living? On the premise that God can predestine anyone
he feels like to invariably come to him without thereby doing violence to
their freedom, libertarian freedom is false and theological determinism is a
logical necessity. Thomists often feel the need to pretend otherwise, but
really Calvin was just far more honest about things than they. To have an
infallible method to pull someone from the water and pass them by is to
sentence them to drown. This is done knowingly, willingly, maliciously by the
God of your picture.

This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it formalizes the
‘hopeful’ reasoning by which Christians typically respond to evils in their
life:

Since they chose what they believed would make them happy but instead brought
the opposite and worst possible result, their choice didn’t bring what they
thought it would bring them. Clearly, they are mistaken.

For all the reasons Hart lays out in his Moral Argument, I can’t see any way
to defend the moral propriety ECT (eternal conscious torment). Moral
sensibilities are a kind of aesthetic ‘seeing’, a matter of ‘taste’ (for the
Good) that one develops and hones over time unlike purely dispassionate and
unambiguous perceptions one awakens to about, say, certain math values or
equations like 2+2=4. Granted, that there could be no possible good that would
justify the moral propriety of ECT is “as clear to me” now as 2+2’s equaling
4, still I don’t think the conditions under which one comes to “see” this are
identical. I’m thinking of how Hart’s case against Nietzsche in BOI in the end
comes down to the latter’s have “atrocious taste.”

Any human-to-human brutality and torture just might be drawing on that same
“unknown good” to which Rooney defers. The inquisitors certainly thought so.

“No one has power over the facts of the past and the laws of nature.  
No one has power over the fact that the facts of the past and the laws of
nature entail every fact of the future (i.e., determinism is true)  
Therefore, no one has power over the facts of the future.”

“So, I rejected that we need to think God needs to do what is best for each
individual absolutely – as there is no uniquely ‘best state’ for any
individual, just as there is no uniquely ‘best’ world God could create.”

Brian will say it better! And Hart’s wording is spot on; it just shows Rooney
is holding a bluff. But Rooney is right – he doesn’t need to define or explain
or outline the “unknown” good. It wouldn’t matter, because it’s the work it’s
being asked to do in making ECT morally intelligible that exposes its failure.

The whole attempt to defend a purely ‘logical possibility’ of ‘God having a
good reason to let some creatures consign themselves to irrevocable torment’
has to be viewed in light of what it would say about God ‘morally’ to suppose
he would freely, unnecessarily, and gratuitously create such a world. You can
see the issue. When it comes down to THIS simple question – whether one can
even imagine of such an act as ‘good’ for some unspecified logically possible
reason – it’s nothing but the moral imagination and sense weighing in. Logical
possibility is benched at that point.

As for God creating everything *ex-nihilo*, this is merely what *both* the
Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Churches officially teach, nothing more,
nothing less.

“Do you think that, if we learned that God permitted someone to resist loving
Him forever, that is, God did not ever eventually cause that person to love
Him, should we immediately conclude that God is not all-good?”

“Universalism has been marginal in Christian history, even when it was
purportedly a more widespread view.”

It wasn’t any shocking experience that jolted me out of believing in ECT. I
did very little ‘free thinking’ about it. My faith tradition and church family
and ministry colleagues obligated me to believe it, and since I valued those
things, and couldn’t imagine giving them up, and would lose them if I
challenged ECT, I consented. Eventually I did get around to ‘thinking freely’
about Hell, letting my explore what I really thought and felt about it. I
discovered it had zero personal hold on my mind. It’s appeal was entirely the
social benefits it provided.

My principle concern here, however, is with Rooney’s philosophical case
against hard universalism, as he calls it, which he identifies as the view
that “it is not _possible_ for anyone to end up in hell for eternity.” And
when he speaks of someone ending “up in hell for eternity,” he has in mind, I
presume, someone’s going to hell and then remaining there for _an unending
period of time_. I emphasize this point because of several imprecisions in his
basic argument against universalism, which runs as follows:

Consider next the second option that Rooney offers above: the option “that
human beings could not do otherwise than love God.” Is this supposed to imply
that newborn babies come into their earthly lives already loving God? If so,
then no universalist should concede the relevance of such an absurdity as
that; and if this second option does not carry such an absurd implication,
then how _are_ we to understand it? Again, it is certainly true that we humans
normally emerge and mature into adults in a context of considerable ambiguity,
ignorance, and misperception. So any implication that we “could not do
otherwise than love God” _during our earthly lives_ would likewise be both
absurd and clearly irrelevant to the claim that God will save everyone in the
end. So again, just how are we to understand this second option? Because
Rooney offers nary a clue concerning a more precise formu­la­tion of it, one
that avoids the obviously absurd implications just mentioned, I shall here
propose, as an alternative to his second option, what I take to be the sober
truth of this matter.

That is, not to put too fine a point on it, a load of bull. There is no
distinction between creating, uncompelled and ex-nihilo, that which you know
will result in a certain outcome and creating that outcome. If you know
infallibly “if A then B” and you do A you have also done B. Once you
incorporate your own beliefs about predestination into the mix this is even
more blatantly false.

I appreciate the tender sense of the Bridegroom’s intimacy with the Bride,
indeed this is part of what *communion* means.

I concede that “fatal” was too strong, and I do not doubt that given the
Catholic audience of your article, there was/is no misunderstanding. But
philosophers live and die by clear definitions, do they not?

The sight of hell torments will exalt the happiness of the saints forever. Can
the believing father in Heaven be happy with his unbelieving children in Hell?
I tell you, yea! Such will be his sense of justice that it will increase
rather than diminish his bliss. [“The Eternity of Hell Torments” (Sermon),
April 1739 & Discourses on Various Important Subjects, 1738]

“Learning new facts about the world, God, or yourself need not change what you
want.”

[2] C. S. Lewis, _Surprised by Joy_ (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,
1955), p. 232.

So, God’s keeping His promises to Abraham is not a free act? That can’t be
right. But even if your odd use of ‘free’ is granted, your admission about
promises to Abraham undermines your position. God, having freely chosen to
make a promise, must, because of who He is, keep it .Likewise, God, having
freely chosen to make creatures for the sake of union with Him, must, because
of who He is, bring about their union with Him.

Seeing as this despicable belief is profoundly irrational and that propagating
it constitutes nothing short of the most vile psychological abuse, I can only
assume that Fr Rooney doesn’t realize what he is doing.

It thus seems to me that – if the Church of today is right in opposing
exclusivism and endorsing inclusivism – then it has been in just as much a
“grave institutional error” for the past 2000 years than it would be if
universalism were true.

“As I’ve repeatedly argued, the burden of proof is the other way around: my
argument is simply that there is no good reason why God cannot permit people
to persist in sin forever. I do not need to outline or imagine any reason God
had for permitting it, let alone an ‘aesthetic’ one (which I reject). But you
are quite right that this dispute is largely a question of ‘taste’ insofar as
universalists think that they can conclude God could not permit anyone to be
lost merely on the basis of their imagination as to what God’s reasons are
like. To think one gets that kind of wide-ranging knowledge of all logical
possibilities of what God’s reasons could be like (that one needs in order to
be a universalist) from your intuition (or sensibility or imagination) is very
implausible.”

However if you want to claim that it´s still possible for the intellect to
reject him in a culpable way, then it seems that we either have no telos at
all or that it´s not directed at God, which brings us back to the first horn.
In these cases God would just be an irrelevant intruder on our way to
destination. Of course, in these cases, nobody can be held responsible for not
loving/worshipping/being drawn to him, because, equally with worship of Zeus,
he´d ultimately be irrelevant for what we are and supposed to be. Ideas like
sufficient grace would go out the window, too.

“Similarly for creation. God could always create a better world. Both of these
principles are important because there are what we might call ‘kinds’ of
worlds in which Gods everything that is best for those in each world, but none
of which is uniquely the only best one.”

I wonder if you would accept the following claims. In the next life, it
remains possible for God to convince John of the error of his ways. Because He
loves John, God will continue trying to convince John of the error of his
ways. If John were convinced, his post-mortem suffering would end.

The Church Fathers and Mothers are “just” teachers that serious Christians
ought to *draw inspiration from* and whose *character* they should seek to
emulate – and even then, there are quite a few exceptions such as Jerome, who
appears to have been quite a PEST, as well as Pope Theophilus of Alexandria
and Emperor Justinian.  
That is “all”… And yet, in a very real sense, that is *already a lot*.

As you probably know, reason for the medievals had two parts, the ratio and
the intellectus. The latter is reason in a poetic mode. Art can degrade into
sophistry, but the flourishing excellence of thought is not separate from the
imagination. It’s a false dichotomy to posit the aesthetic as a frivolous
imposition. The whole point of the Prolegomena to Balthasar’s Theological
Aesthetics was to clarify the terrible consequences for theology when Beauty
is ignored in the supposed name of Truth. Beauty is the radiance of Being. You
assert that universalists replace reason with imagination and culpably fail to
trust the Goodness of God. I believe you give both reason and imagination
short shrift, ignore the most compelling interpretation of scripture which
announces a victory over evil that subverts what appears plausible to a merely
heroic, epic theology where intransigent evil can only ever be overcome from
without, accepting as a necessary consequence that the defeated may persist
eternally as an unredeemed residue of the vanquished. Your particular view of
authority and tradition, which is common, requires the faithful to accept a
conception of divine love that is manifestly inadequate.

This isn’t a “vicious misrepresentation of Catholicism” and this is no
“slander” at all : this is the uncomfortable truth about what Catholics are
supposed to believe according to the official teachings of their own Church.  
The fact that the RC Church is very careful not to *put* things this way in
its official Catechism does not actually change anything because this
conclusion is a *logically inevitable* one for anyone that takes what it
teaches in this garbage of a book too seriously.

Tom: “My guess is Fr Rooney will say he takes God’s goodness as a given as
well. What he’s disputing is not God’s goodness, but whether the Good God can
have no ‘good reason’ for permitting creatures to freely condemn themselves to
an eternal hell.”

          * ![](https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/15a7dabe445ed0980cb843b2e64ded36?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) Tom Talbott says:

“Predestination, in fact, need not be invoked here at all. Brush the issue
entirely aside. Let us suppose instead that rational creatures possess real
autonomy of almost godlike scope, and that no one goes to hell save by his or
her own Promethean industry and ingenuity: When we then look at God’s decision
to create from that angle, we find, curiously enough, that absolutely nothing
changes. Not to wax too anthropomorphizing here, like a poor simpleminded
analytic philosopher of religion who thinks of God as some immense finite
agent similar to us (if much more imposing), but we really should pause to
interrogate the logic of God’s motives in the story as commonly told. Let us,
that is, say God created simply on the chance that humanity might sin, and on
the chance that a certain number of incorrigibly wicked souls might plunge
themselves into the fiery abyss forever. This still means that, morally, he
has purchased the revelation of his power in creation by the same horrendous
price—even if, in the end, no one at all should happen to be damned. The logic
is irresistible. God creates. The die is cast. Alea iacta est. But then again,
as Mallarmé says, “Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard” (A throw of the
dice will never abolish the hazard): for what is hazarded has already been
surrendered, entirely, no matter how the dice may fall. The outcome of the
aleatory venture may be intentionally indeterminate, but the wager itself is
an irrevocable intentional decision, wherein every possible cost has already
been accepted; the irrecuperable expenditure has been offered even if,
happily, it is never actually lost, and so the moral nature of the act is the
same in either case. To venture the life of your child for some other end is,
morally, already to have killed your child, even if at the last moment Artemis
or Heracles or the Angel of the LORD should stay your hand. And so, the
revelation of God’s glory in creatures would still always be dependent upon
that evil, or that venture beyond good and evil, even if at the last no one
should perish. Creation could never then be called “good” in an unconditional
sense; nor God the “Good as such,” no matter what conditional goods he might
accomplish in creating. And, here too, the losing lot might just as well have
fallen to the blessed, given the stochastic vagaries of existence: accidents
of birth, congenital qualities of character, natural intellectual endowments,
native moral aptitudes, material circumstances, personal powers of resolve,
impersonal forces of chance, the grim encumbrances of sin and mortality … The
saved might, by this or that small twist of fate or folly, have been the
damned, and the damned the saved. Once again then, who would the damned be but
the redeemers of the blessed, the price eternally paid by God for the sake of
the Kingdom’s felicity?”

Does this not sound more like Hart’s conception of human freedom than it does
Rooney’s conception of it? Consider how carefully Lewis chose his words in the
larger context leading up to the above quotation. He observed first that
“before God closed in on me, I was in fact offered what now appears a moment
of wholly free choice.” But lest this remark should be misunderstood, he
immediately added the following clarification: “I say, ‘I chose,’ yet it did
not really seem possible to do the opposite [or to do otherwise]. . . . You
could argue that I was not a free agent, but I am more inclined to think that
this came nearer to being a perfectly free act than most that I have ever
done. Necessity may not [always] be the opposite of freedom . . .” So here
Lewis explicitly contradicts Rooney’s apparent assumption that necessity
always is the opposite of freedom, and he thus illustrates the usefulness of a
more subtle account of freedom, one that does not simply identify freedom with
the power to do otherwise. And as I have already suggested in the previous
section, a more subtle account should include these two ideas: first, that
moral freedom requires that one has surpassed a certain threshold of
rationality, and, second, that an utterly irrational choice cannot possibly
qualify as a choice for which one is morally responsible.

But as Hart would hasten to add – if God has created creatures with free wills
who will ultimately choose to reject God’s love forever and cast themselves
into an eternal hell of unimaginable torments…then He is not Good.

“If my state were such that I could not (simply) have done otherwise than
believe X, and I do Y on the basis of my belief X, then my action Y could not
have been otherwise. Imagining that Y is a bad action . . . , I would not be
morally culpable for [Y].”

You entirely misinterpret what I am saying about Christology and personhood. I
am not asserting a “real relation.” Take a look at Norris Clarke’s various
writings. The pithy Person and Being is a helpful brief work. The substance-
and-relation constitution of beings is a metaphysics of nature. I think
Christology adds insight into protology and eschatology that deepen our
understanding of Creation and the intimacy of the divine that transcends the
usual metaphysical ponderings, but I surmise that is beyond what can be
addressed in this conversation.

“People can want things that do not correspond to what they ought to want (and
do not necessarily or by nature want to love God).”

Me: “it has to make ‘eternal conscious torment’ *morally* (not *mortally*)
intelligible in its light.” Sorry.

Of course not, because you already want what only he can give you. But that’s
not where you were going with this, you want to posit something much worse
than a banal truism.

Your parallelism is flawed here. The Church is the Body of Christ in all its
fullness, with Christ himself as the Head. Your position in defense of
universalism raises even more problems — now Christological and
ecclesiological.

For this reason I have proposed that we universalists should avoid the word
“hell” when describing our position. Personally, I prefer the term “Gehenna”
or “purgatory” in order to avoid confusion. A similar problem occurs when we
Orthodox discuss the Last Things with Western Christians. We often use the
word “hell” as the post-mortem “place” of the wicked, even though the more
accurate word would be “hades,” given that we do not believe that those in
hades are beyond God’s mercy. Through the prayers of the Church, the wicked
may still be delivered by God from hell into Paradise. The real hell does not
begin until the Final Judgment.

Fr. Rooney goes on to define God’s love as doing what is best for others.  
“God does what is best for them even when they turn against His love.”

None of those quotes support your contention that the Catholic Church teaches
that God is a “monster God who creates, ex nihlo and with foreknowledge,
sentient creatures who He knows will fall and thus condemn themselves of their
own “free-will” to an eternity of suffering. … Zeus-like Being.”

But there you have it Joe. For Rooney, the “moral sense” is just the
“imagination” (flimsy untrustworthy thing; even though it’s by the imagination
that he produces his “unknown good” sufficient to morally justify ECT). But
the moral sense be damned, all we need to resolve the dispute, according to
Rooney, is to posit what is “logically possible,” and since logical
possibilities cannot be the subject of moral adjudication, I suppose the
debate is over. But the problem here, of course, is that Rooney asks this
logical possibility to do the work of ‘morally’ justifying a free and
unnecessary act which ends in eternal conscious torment. And I’ll say again,
because it’s true, that nothing but one’s moral sensibilities, one’s
moral/aesthetic “taste” inclines one to seeing such an act as morally
intelligible or unintelligible.  
Lastly:

I can see how, for you, the reality or unreality of hell is related to the
problem of evil, more broadly speaking. If God can allow such protracted and
unimaginably profound suffering now, in the present—and presumably for a good
reason— well, why might he not allow such suffering eternally…and also not
have a good reason?

(And I should add: I think it is perfectly legitimate to hope in God’s
goodness that He might save all. All that I object to is the claim that it is
necessarily true that He does so, i.e., impossible that it could be
otherwise.)

The dialogue is utterly confused, Tom, because the ambiguity of terms is
exacerbated by a constant shifting between creaturely freedom in its potency
and it’s flourishing perfection, as well as concommitent confusions regarding
Divine agency. It’s why I pulled back on Christology because that brings in
even more complications regarding analogia entis and the pleromatic fullness
of human personhood rooted in Christ. If we are already floundering, to bring
up considerations that presuppose a sensibility attuned to the symbolic depths
of revelatory being is a bridge too far. I’m likely going to retreat back into
my cave and let the rest of you poor lot wrestle with the stalwart defenders
of orthodoxy.

So is this an adequate understanding of divine freedom? Not in my opinion. Set
aside the great questions (that occupy so much of Rooney’s attention)
concerning the possibility that God might not have created anything at all or
might not have entered into his own creation by way of an Incarnation. Is it
not a necessary truth, according to traditional Christian theology (not to
mention Titus 1:2), that God never lies? And is it not likewise a necessary
truth that God never chooses to break a promise? If these are indeed logical
necessities, it looks as if, according to Rooney, God never speaks the truth
freely and never keeps his promises freely. In his dispute with David Bentley
Hart, Rooney thus writes: “Being free [always?] involves being such that one
can act on _other_ reasons; necessitation looks strictly incompatible with
[divine] freedom for that reason.” But again, isn’t that just obviously false,
given a Christian understanding of the divine perfections? For even if God
could have acted on “other reasons” and have refrained from making any
promises at all, there are surely no possible reasons upon which he might
conceivably act for the purpose of breaking a promise. Neither are there any
possible reasons upon which he might conceivably act for the purpose of
issuing certain kinds of commands. To give just one example, it is logically
impossible, surely, that a God whose very essence is perfect love should issue
a command that we torture babies for our own sadistic pleasure. So given such
a logical impossibility as that, does it not follow, given Rooney’s conception
of divine freedom, that God is not really free in this matter? Like Hart, I
would argue instead that God’s freedom consists simply in his being true to
himself, whether or not he could have done otherwise with respect to some
specific action; and in a similar vein, C. S. Lewis, whom Rooney appears to
revere, once put it this way:

Frankly, Fr. Rooney’s conjecture that God may have a good reason to allow His
child to suffer eternally seems incongruent with a God who is love, omniscient
and omnipotent.

Of course there is never any mention of what this “good reason” might be.

That actually sums up several vitally important Roman Catholic ideas pretty
well (Papal Infallibility and all that).

If it is, then once we come in contact with him, then theres no rational
option for our rational intellect to reject him, after all we´re already at
our goal. A rejection couldn´t come from a rational decision, I can´t even
describe how that decision against him could come about (can you?), but
through a kind of reflex. But this is hardly something we´re culpable for, no?
It is similarly not just to judge the madman for his incapacity to think
straight.

The main claim of yours I deny, however, is that God puts Himself in contact
with us such that it would be impossible for us to have done otherwise than
love Him. God allows us to reject His love. As I noted in my article, you only
need three truths to get you to the possibility of hell:

Here is a quote from Hart’s “That All Shall Be Saved” that leapt off the page
as I read it…

On your view, is it *possible*, while he is in Hell, for John’s desire to
change, i.e. *could* he subsequently want to be convinced of the error of his
ways?

> follows that no sinners will ever go there.

The point of my response (with a link directly to a core relevant part of the
article here) is that (1) your argument is easily responded to, and doesn’t
hold, and also furthermore (2) in fact, your conception of god is not free.

“You believe that imperfect freedom of individuals as you posit it is
dispositive for eternal destinies. Universalists do not agree and they are not
required by logic or metaphysical necessity to do so.”

But the language of freedom also gets used to describe a certain liberty of
agency possessed by natures not yet perfected in their final end, natures
which are ‘en route’ to that end, whose final ‘freedom’ depends upon the
proper use of this ‘en route’ liberty. We are “at liberty to become free”
where “liberty” in this sentence refers to that precarious, risky venture of
deliberative agency (minimally understood, not an Enlightenment voluntarism)
and “freedom” refers to the consummate perfection in love which is that
agency’s end.

I don’t see any logical problem (only one of imagination) that prevents us
from affirming that, if God DID permit someone to persist in mortal sin
forever, God would only do this for some good reason. Nor do I see that we
need to know what that reason would be in order to be confident that good
would triumph.

Calvin: “ There is something deeply wrong with you, and with any faith in
which this could be considered an orthodox position.”

“This is to say that God allows sin and damnation because He can redeem it.
That redemption, however, -on the orthodox Christian story- does not require
universal salvation.”

So, on your view, God loves John and God allows John to suffer eternally.

Consensus is hardly the way that truth is decided. After all, the Western
(Roman Catholic) Church came to the consensus that the Filioque Clause to the
Creed is acceptable (despite the warnings of anathema against tampering with
the canonical decisions of councils), that Augustine’s erroneous idea of
“Original Sin” and the guilt of Adam being owned by all human beings, that
Mary was immaculately conceived in the womb of Anna, that there is a “Treasury
of Merit” from which one might draw favor and thus avoid the wrath of God,
etc,. etc., etc.

The inference of 1 to the reality of mortal sin is invalid. I don’t believe
there’s sin great enough to separate us from an infinitely loving being and
accepting that uncontroversial premise (eating sweets while being on a diet is
an example of it) doesn’t lead me to having to accept the possibility of that
concept unless we invoke a doctrinal background as a hidden premise.

Yes, let us hope that God’s goodness is good enough…to do what is clearly
within the scope of infinite goodness.

Also, please enlighten us what God´s reasons could be in not securing the good
end for everyone. Is it the delight of the Saints in watching the tortured
souls? Up until this point the most I see from you are skeptical theist thesis
“God may have reasons for that”, but I´d be really interested in what you
think these reasons might be. And, more importantly, which reasons would
convince you in seeing that being still being worthy of worship?

You write, “it is also not possible for God to convince John of the error of
his ways, if John does not want to be convinced.”

“2. Learning new facts about the world, God, or yourself need not change what
you want.”

What then, does it mean to love oneself? Does it make sense that a rational
human being would choose to resist their own happiness and embrace eternal
suffering as the price for resisting God’s love? If loving yourself means
doing what is best for yourself, then surely it is deranged to believe that
rejecting the Father who is the giver of every good and perfect gift will
achieve your intended goal. Remember happiness is the reason that Fr. Rooney
says people choose hell in the first place only to encounter the stark reality
that suffering is their new reality. And yet…Fr. Rooney maintains that those
in hell will continue there because they love pain more than God. They have
determined that suffering is in their best interest.

In fact, if you compare Western translations of the Greek with the actual
meanings of the words, you will see this tendency to make everything about
legal jurisprudence and punishment instead of healing.

I am all in favor of “redefinition toward a common understand” which amplifies
and deepens, but does not contradict, the received understanding.

Again, I distinguish: it remains possible in God’s absolute power to do many
things. It would have been absolutely possible for God to create John and
confirm John in grace with no action on John’s part, causing John to love God
without any prior possibility of resistance. But, given God’s decision to
create John within a world in which God chooses to allow creatures to resist
His grace, it is not possible within that scope of God’s intentions that God
merely cause John to love Him in such a way that John was unable to have done
otherwise. All God’s grace is given such that creatures could have resisted
that grace and failed to love Him. In this sense, it is also not possible for
God to convince John of the error of his ways, if John does not want to be
convinced.

“God is not free to choose ‘not to be loving,’ but He is free in His choice to
love some creatures into being (with the natures that they have), among all
the other possible ones He could have created, as well as in any subsequent
commitments to act in a certain way toward those creatures.”

The Church unites — both the ministerial (ordained) priesthood and the
baptismal (Royal) priesthood — in thanksgiving (eucharistia), in adoration
(latria) of the Blessed Trinity, and in sacrifice under the sacramental signs
(doing what Christ commands us in memoriam, and offering our selves conjoined
to the Sacrifice of Christ through the ministerial priesthood offering the
gifts) for the salvation of the world and the sanctification of the faithful.

Please direct me to your best summary of your own understanding of the
language of punishment/correction/mercy/damnation in the afterlife. I will
give it careful consideration.

The question is not whether universal salvation would be possible, but whether
it must be the case. I am only denying that it must be the case – that is,
that it cannot be otherwise than that all persons eventually love God and
experience salvation, i.e., ‘hard universalism.’ I am not arguing against the
possibility of God saving all.

I agree. Morally speaking, it couldn’t be any clearer to me. I have no concept
of love that includes God’s permitting the irrevocable loss of those he loves.

My hunch is virtually all who defend ECT do so for similar reasons. Those
reasons constrain, and can even silence, the moral imagination – which just
shows how powerful our sense of belonging is when it’s connected to religious
identity. And there’s nothing wrong with the power of that combination as
such. But it does mean that sometimes immediate existential needs (individual
and social) trump moral values. We tend to morally approve of what creates and
strengthens our connections and disapprove of what fragments and isolates us.

Why would the cross be meaningless? Jesus’ death on the cross is a martyrdom
in our favor: Jesus remained faithful to his message of an infinitely loving
God even unto death, thus making it possible for us to trust in this message.
He was killed by those who also scare others with religious ideas in order to
rule over them. This by no means excludes that God’s love will have the last
word. The whole world has been created from the beginning into the eternal
love of God for God, into the love of the Father for the Son, which is the
Holy Spirit. Through the incarnation of the Son, this fundamental mystery of
faith is revealed.

“Thus, hell is not the worst state of a person, since it is a place where
God’s love is present and God is doing what is best for someone, insofar as it
is in God’s power to do so, given what He wills for the universe and the rest
of humanity.”

It’s certainly a false dilemma to assert that one must choose between the
sacramental life of the Church and the claims of Christian universalism. If
the countless millions who live their lives outside the historical reach of
the Church are part of God’s salvific care, then explicit participation in the
Liturgy is not a prerequisite to eternal life. A better way to think about it,
I think, is to recognize that the Church nurtures the lives of saints. The
exclusivity of the Eucharist is not an insular movement. We seek to grow more
and more into the life of Christ which is intrinsically an impulse towards
mission. There is perhaps a frequent tendency to think salvation as forensic
forgiveness, so that to say all are saved is equated with indifference towards
how people have lived their lives. Of course, this is entirely wrongheaded.
Folks who say, “Why bother then?” simply are ignorant of the beauty of Christ.
Why bother with Love? Why seek the one thing necessary? The grace of the
sacraments is one with the hidden kenosis of the Spirit. The unique life of
the Church is always “for the others.” It’s raison d’etre is the fundamental
renewal of the Creation through union with God.

[1] I defend this claim in a presentation I made at the Door Standing Open
Conference in Providence, Rhode Island, on April 28, 2018. The presentation
was entitled “How to Read the Bible from a Universalist Perspective,” and it
is available at the following URL:
<http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/Reading%20the%20Bible.pdf>

There is so much confusion and illicit claims of logical inference in Fr.
Rooney’s various proclamations that one despairs of countering what is in
effect a Hydra head of errors serenely unaware and perfectly satisfied that
the truth is secured by the deposit of faith and Tradition, so even if a
defense is obtuse, what does it matter? Thomas Talbott writes a clarifying
article to stipulate details insufficiently addressed in Fr. Rooney’s initial
premises and Fr. Rooney concludes that all representatives of apokatastasis
agree to the two forks of his argument. If Talbott fully agreed, he would not
have been compelled to write an article explaining what was inadequate in Fr.
Rooney’s statements. Nor can Talbott’s agreement or disagreement in any
fashion be taken as proof of what all universalists think or grant. So, on a
very basic level, Fr. Rooney exhibits a characteristic lack of precision.

Not really. Plotinus denied of the One, that it is an intellect, since that
proposal, as found in Aristotle and Aquinas, leads to complexity, which is why
the intellect is located within the demiurge. The One/God is just naturally
the Form of the Good and everything is directed to the One. Universalism is a
natural complement. Everything God/The One does is because of what it is, no
external reasons are needed or metaphysically coherent if introduced

I agree with your last point insofar that – if the church were to teach
explicit universalism – this would indeed mark a significant historical
turning point and should be acknowledged (although I would see this as a
deepening and extension of past teachings)

As for the saints, I think their loving God is invariant, or not going to
change, but argue that this does not undermine their freely engaging in that
love (in light of reasons I already mentioned). I do think that the saints
have free will in other respects, such as choosing to pray for someone in
particular, or shift their attention, or whatever. These other choices involve
no necessitation whatsoever, aside from the limits on what they choose that
result from their continuously loving God and the limits of actions open to
them existing as separated souls, so I don’t see that discussing these other
actions is relevant.

Even one? Give me a hard challenge. Here are two that represent the worst of
Roman Catholic thinking:

I also need to apologize to three commentators whom I shall not name. This
morning I discovered your comments in the WordPress spam box. This so rarely
happens that I have grown slack in checking it. Anyway, your comments have
been recovered and approved.

If you answer that it is possible for John to change his mind, then universal
salvation follows. For God can certainly accomplish the possible.

Again, it would probably be very helpful if you could answer my original
questions, as these may touch on the underlying logic and motivation for your
thinking in these matters.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him or

If, – the self-proclaimed worst of sinners – Saul, on the Damascus road freely
embraced the full revelation of the love of Christ, will not each one of us do
the same either now or on the other side of the veil.

Believing, as Fr. Rooney does, that those in hell will demonstrate love for
themselves by eternally rejecting everything man was created to desire is
nonsensical.  
So now let’s consider whether God might have a good reason for permitting
creatures to condemn themselves to an eternity of suffering.

Fr Rooney: “They choose what they believe will make them happy – even though
it, in fact, will bring them eternal suffering…”

It is not only possible, but quite easy. God cannot will anything less than
the Good for anyone, therefore he cannot will anything except the fullness of
deifying union for all creation. There can be no suboptimal state which God
can will as a final end. Nor can there be any “good reason” outside the Good,
which is what anyone in hell would be. The Good is all good reasons, hence no
good reason can anything else but total union with the good as its outcome.

This is a common challenge for us all — how ought a universalist know if he is
really seeing clearly? I cannot answer how it is that I see clearly either,
but I submit to the apostolic Church which I believe was founded by Christ on
the apostles and their successors, and was institutionally graced with the
Holy Spirit to safeguard the Gospel and the sacraments and to lead the Church
into the fullness of truth. Clarity does not reside in my brain, but in the
*mens ecclesiae* faithfully defending and promoting the *depositum fidei*. I
believe that this is the only grasp any of us can have for any epistemic
certitude.

Revisiting Rooney’s argument: “I am only arguing that it is impossible to show
that it could not be possible God might have a good reason to allow people to
resist His love forever.”

I should add that given what we call a human being’s transcendental grounding,
there is always some irreducible approximation of the Good in all human
desiring and intending. Hart describes this well. Nothing new.

The Eucharist is indeed the unbloody sacrifice of love — it is offered in a
now unbloody manner because there is no symbolic victim (scapegoat or ram or
animal offering) but the Lord is the victim and the High Priest. It is indeed
a means of peace, once violently and brutally endured by the Lord, and by
sacramental signs it is peaceful and nonviolent, transcending the historical
and material event of the Lord’s Supper and the Passion, Death, and
Resurrection of the Lord, and is ordered toward the eschatological horizon,
presented in the present moment.

When you claim “freedom as the flourishing of well-being does not reduce to
choice,” you are already misunderstanding the scope of my claim about NINF.
It’s just a claim about a necessary condition for being free, not a sufficient
one for having freedom of flourishing. When I later talk about culpability,
however, I am addressing your concern that to choose to do things that are
sinful are not free. In one sense, it is quite true that sin is a kind of
slavery. But it is, on the other hand, a freely chosen slavery. As Anselm put
it, free will is the capacity to preserve rectitude of the will for
rectitude’s own sake. One loses rectitude in sinning, but one does not thereby
lose that capacity for preserving rectitude, nor does it mean that one was
incapable of preserving rectitude of will when one sinned. In short, the only
way to make yourself a slave of sin is to do so willingly and culpably, that
is, freely.

Yes, on my view, both can be true. Obviously, God loves those who are in hell;
otherwise, they wouldn’t even exist. But, more importantly, I believe God only
permits hell insofar as the world in which hell exists is good *for John* to
be in. That’s not to say hell is good for John, just to say that God’s
permission of what happens to John could not be disconnected from His love of
John.

What struck me was his uncomplicated conclusion.  
“So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.”

If you’ve read my writings on Gehenna, Steven, then you know that I have never
claimed that Jesus was only speaking prophetically of some future event
concerning Jerusalem. I think you must be thinking of someone else.

Me: “As far as what the Church may permit or not permit as permissible, that’s
different.” Pretty choppy and unclear. Sorry. Maybe “…what the Church may
permit or not permit to be believed…”

It’s not only the uncomfortable truth for Catholics but for ALL classical
theists who embrace infernalism.

On your first point I’d point out that Adam, Abraham and all the other OT
saints never received the sacraments – at least not in any conventional sense
– and yet the Church teaches that they are saved.

It seems the onus resides with those claiming a new interpretation against a
massive, constant, internally consistent, and historical body of theology and
liturgical praxis which does not accept that all people, as well as Satan and
the demons, will finally be reconciled in the love and adoration of the
Blessed Trinity in the Heavenly Jerusalem.

Fr. Rooney, here it seems to me that you are simply lying about what you
believe. I have seen for myself the Twitter thread wherein you say that you
believe that God can cause someone to inevitably come to him without doing
violence to their freedom. Unless this has changed, then God torturing anyone
forever is by no means “the best” that he could be doing for them.

There is much that could be commented on in Fr Rooney’s response to this
article <https://tinyurl.com/ycxyh2uc> but the following stood out to me…

[4] See, for example, my explanation of the source libertarian view in my book
[_Understanding the Free Will Controversy: Thinking through a Philosophical
Quagmire_](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Free-Will-Controversy-

Companions/dp/1725268361?_encoding=UTF8&qid68883595&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tagìlectorthod-20&linkIdM1460ef4262a49a5ad2ed8cb9249b74&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
(Eugene, OR; Cascade Books, 2022), pp. 15-17.

It would all depend on the ‘final end’ in light of which such evils and
suffering are judged. To conclude God is Good in spite of temporal evils, even
unspeakable temporal horrors encountered ‘en route’ – that’s one thing. There
is a “final end” in light of which all ‘en route’ evils are judged. But to
conclude God is Good in light ‘eternal’ torment? There is a profound
difference. Hart:

In the end, we see that with respect to Universalism and ECT, each logically
imposes itself upon us as the ‘only possible’ pathway God could take to create
a world intended for union with himself. As far as what the Church may permit
or not permit as permissible, that’s different. Let’s say the Church permits
both positions. Fine. But that doesn’t mean the believers of either are able
to concede the real possibility of the truth of the other position as a
possibility inherent in their own position. I think that’s ruled out. I don’t
think there’s a way Universalism can be true and God be the sort of God who
could risk ECT (but just freely decided not to take that route). No. Likewise,
I don’t see how ECT can be true and God be the sort of God whose goodness and
love ‘could’ preclude his freely risking ECT but he just freely decided to
take the ECT route. Whichever is true, it follows as necessarily true given
(a) the nature of divine love, and (b) the truth of creation ex nihilo.

You cannot bring good out of a neverending evil. It is no more possible than a
triangular circle.

Of course, it is impossible to wrong someone who does not exist. There is no
such thing as the injustice of nonexistence. But what the hell? Any argument,
no matter how absurd, is better than admitting how evil and incoherent the
infernalist teaching is.

“So too a person who fails to love God and ends up in everlasting separation
from Him falls short of the mark, being a defective human being, but is not
thereby any less a rational or responsible person.”

[3] C. S. Lewis, _The Problem of Pain_ (New York: Macmillan, 1944), p. 23.

I find it interesting, by the way, how many of the early libertarian
philosophers who, like you, identified moral freedom with the power of
contrary choice —everyone from C. A. Campbell to Peter van Inwagen—winded up
concluding that we humans have precious little freedom of the will.

For your first point, on the salvation given the Patriarchs and others under
the First Covenant, the OT prefigures the perfection of the New Covenant in
the Christ’s blood. The signs of the old order of sacrifice are “sacramental”
(circumcision, the offerings of Abel, Melchizedek, Abraham, Aaron) in a primal
sense of the word. But they are not said to be the same order as the
sacraments of the Church which are *acts* of Christ as the High Priest
perfecting and fulfilling the Old Law and instituting the New Covenant.

It is highly relevant actually and exposes the incoherencies of your view. It
is truly wondrous how God would respect the free will of his creatures in
hell, but determine us once in heaven. Got us in his mousetrap there, I
assume. The way better answer is that once in the presence of God, the soul is
incapable of drawing away from him. After all, it is the fulfillment ouf the
deepest desires of our nature which we find in him. The problem for you is of
course, the obvious universalist implications of that view, because once the
gnomic and natural will get aligned in purgatory, it naturally follows that in
a limited time the soul will be drawn to God, even the most twisted ones will
be eventually.

Fr Rooney: Do you think that, if we learned that God permitted someone to
resist loving Him forever, that is, God did not ever eventually cause that
person to love Him, should we immediately conclude that God is not all-loving
and good? Do you think that, knowing God is Good, there is no possible way for
Him to bring good from eternal resistance of some to His love?

As we have seen from the responses here, both from Fr. Rooney and the
corrections given by his interlocutors, the need to be right appears to
override the ability to cogently think about the reality of what is actually
being defended.

Rooney avoids one of Talbott’s prominent examples: God keeping his promises.
Presumably, Rooney thinks that, e.g., God keeping his promises to Abraham is
‘outside’ of His own life and hence an object of His free choice. Presumably,
he also thinks that it is impossible for God to break His promises rather than
keep them. The conclusion is not hard to draw.

So you would say God did NOT know from the beginning that most of his
creatures will go to hell?

Slander is very heavy, indeed a mortal, moral burden for you to bear.

“The Fathers who purportedly taught universalism, such as Gregory of Nyssa, do
not represent the consensus of the Fathers”.

Fr Rooney: A response to Brian above: “…folks here are not granting your
necessary condition [on freedom].” If you do not think it is a necessary
condition for freedom that you have the ability to have done otherwise, simply
and absolutely, then causal determinism…”

” I do think that the saints have free will in other respects, such as
choosing to pray for someone in particular, or shift their attention, or
whatever. These other choices involve no necessitation whatsoever, aside from
the limits on what they choose that result from their continuously loving God
and the limits of actions open to them existing as separated souls, so I don’t
see that discussing these other actions is relevant.”

I also understand and agree with your desire for the sacraments to ‘mean’
something – to have real efficacy – but I do not think you have demonstrated
that the universalist position implies they do not.

Therefore – while I understand you originally raised the point to highlight
God does not positively will hell – it does seem that the logical implication
of your position must be that eternal suffering is a preferable state of
affairs to non-existence (unless you are using the term ‘preferable’
equivocally).

1) they did not receive the sacraments and yet they are still saved – in which
case, there is no problem for universalism after all (at least, if there is a
problem, then it’s a problem for all forms of Christianity, not just
universalism)

Redeem it? Are you incapable of cognitive dissonance? On your belief he
*caused it*. Apropos of, quite literally, nothing. Just, bam, gonna create a
few billion people to scream in agony forever for no particular reason. This
is neither love nor is it anything discernable as justice, it is cruel
insanity. To worship it is nihilism, plain and simple.

It’s incredibly important at this point that we define what love means in this
context.

One does not have to fully understand the implications of a sinful act for it
to be mortal and the person to be culpable, and there are various diminishing
factors of culpability that might be applied in moral analysis which mitigate
but still have caused the loss of sanctifying grace.

So please enlighten me: What am I supposed to love here? Are you just loving a
name? Or a mental image that you developed after decades of dogma? Or is it
rather the case, like within Brahmanian schools, that the claim to love him,
proves that you haven´t understood what he is?

That next to last quote (“If we did have to know all of God’s reasons for
permitting every instance of evil…”) is Fr Rooney’s. Sorry I didn’t make that
clear.

I see.  
But I think there is a disanalogy here with the consensus in a scientific
community. The reason being that in this case whoever disagreed with the
consensus would be a heretic.  
It would then follow that:  
(1) either whoever disagrees with the consensum patrum could not be a Father,
so that the consensus would have to be totally unanimous by definition
(contrary to our assumption),  
(2) or the Church can still deem a person worthy of the title “Father of the
Church”, even though the same Church has condemned him as an heretic…  
Is there something I am not seeing here?

Rom 5:18 “Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all
men unto justification of life.”

That is a vicious misrepresentation of Catholicism, which is completely
unsupportable from any reading of magisterial Catholic sources — papal or
patristic or curial or conciliar documents, catechisms, approved theological
texts, scriptural commentary, any of the orthodox theologians from any era, or
any where else.

But anyway, do you agree that many of God’s most important actions do not
count as free actions in your sense? Would you also agree that many of our
most important human choices are not free in your sense either? For my own
part, I suspect that most conversions to Christianity, for example, occur in a
context, such as C. S. Lewis described (see my original post), in which the
converts could not have chosen otherwise. Do you disagree with that?

This would be a “reset” of the Church. But the Church is not (in any
magisterial institutional manner) endorsing “inclusivism” as you seem to
understand it to the rejection of the need for the sacraments of salvation.

“And on my account of God’s permission of hell, I already affirmed that God
ensures conditions hold in light of which each individual human being can
flourish supernaturally. That is why an individual human failing to flourish
supernaturally is entirely the fault of that person.”

So, even as Fr. Rooney contends that God wants all to be saved, God seems
powerless to do so and His love becomes his conflicted device of eternal
torture.

I don’t see that I am saying anything that affects whether God’s ‘most
important actions’ are free. All I deny is that God is freely good, not that
the actions He performs which are good are less free. To put it simply, God is
not free to perform an evil action, because those alternatives do not exist
for Him. He does not ‘freely’ not do evil. Conversely, the alternatives open
to God are all good (and He has no uniquely compelling reasons to cause Him to
perform one of these actions over another, since all are good). Any action God
performs, then, is supremely free.

The Eucharist of course, par excellence, is the “source and summit” of the
Christian life (and the Church’s life), and sets the other sacraments in their
proper context. But this is precisely why St Paul is so adamant about
preparing one’s self to receive the Holy Eucharist, because it requires a
concomitant sacrifice of our self in preparing our hearts to receive so great
an encounter with the Resurrected Lord. This is the reason one must abstain
and first reconcile through Confession if one is aware of grave sins. This is
the common Eucharistic discipline in both the East and the West.

In the past you have already argued that freedom doesn´t require alternative
possibilities, so why the double standard here? I won´t even press the PSR on
you here; there will be no way for you to explain how the two different
options in speaking or not speaking to Abraham will be related to the
necessary nature of the divine without introducing contingency into God. But
still, the double standards are baffling. On your account the loving of
creation would be due to his nature. Creation can´t be though, because you
want to preserve the possibility of there being no creation at all. The
creation follows from God´s intention/reasons/desires. But if they´re able to
be changed, then what is their relation to God in the first place? They must
be completely unrelated to his necessary nature, which would explain God
intending/desiring/being impressed of the reasons for X. But this would once
again necessitate them. The inference is so obvious, that only blind adherence
to dogma explains why you´re not following the obvious logical conclusion. God
knows willing, but no choice, for these exact reasons.

“We instead think that God permits hell for only the best sorts of reasons.
And I’ve seen no valid and sound argument that it is impossible for God to
have such a good reason.”

Thank you for that link. While I am tangentially familiar with Fr Bulgakov,
I’m not sure how it touches on my question.

So, God sends them to a permanent, irreparable state of suffering for what is
quite literally a mistaken choice predicated on a mistaken belief. Wow, what a
God!

Finally, I think land minds are an abrogation of the Geneva Convention, but I
could be wrong about that, Tom.

Catholic and Eastern Orthodox believers have exactly the same Church Fathers
and Mothers *up until the middle of the 8th century*, with Saint Bede and a
couple others usually taken to have been the *last* Church Fathers that both
Churches have in common.  
Furthermore, both Churches are very much in agreement on the matter of *what*
exactly makes a Christian a Church Father or Mother.  
Contrarily to the Catholic Church, however, the Orthodox Church is inclined to
consider *all* of its greatest Saints and teachers as Church Fathers and
Mothers, no matter *when* they lived… Thus, in the eyes of many committed
Orthodox believers, the actual list of Church Fathers and Mothers is *much*
longer than the Catholics’ one and it *keeps* getting bigger century after
century : it simply *never* stopped in the middle of the 8th century.  
The Eastern Orthodox list of Church Fathers and Mothers can basically be
divided into several parts, each one corresponding to a distinct era : there
is the “Early Church Fathers & Mothers” part of the list, there’s what can be
called the “Late Church Fathers and Mothers” part… And then, there’s the
“Modern Church Fathers and Mothers” part.  
Spiritual teachers such as St Silouan the Athonite, St Sophrony of Essex (one
of his students as well as his biographer), St Paisios of Mount Athos and St
Porphyrios, are often considered to be *modern* Church Fathers by Eastern
Orthodox believers, to give you just a couple examples.  
Although all of these have been canonised, it should also be noted that *not*
all Church Fathers have been officially declared Saints : Pierius of
Alexandria, Theognostus of Alexandria, Tertullian, Lactantius, and (last but
certainly not least) Origen, are some of those Fathers that were never
canonised, at least not by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches (even though it
is very hard to find anyone who would’ve deserved it more than Origen,
actually).

I don’t believe anyone denies that there is some measure of culpability in the
path that leads to enslavement to sin. What one can properly assert is that it
is also true that no one acts apart from historical and social influences that
shape what appear as possible options for a particular person to deliberate
upon. And that, of course, is ultimately something only God can adequately
discern. Regardless, folks are responsible for sin. Universalists do not deny
this. Do you think they do? Try perusing George MacDonald’s sermon “Justice.”
That will disabuse you of any misconceptions on that point. However, granting
that the sinner bears responsibility for his condition does not require one to
accept that imperfect freedom leading to enslavement requires one to posit
grace as ultimately checkmated by the power of ignorant sin to prevail and
resist love’s capacity to heal and bind the lost to the kingdom of bliss.

You suggest that an eternity in hell is not the absolute worst state for a
creature to be in, and that it is at any rate preferable to absolute non-
existence.

“In this sense, it is also not possible for God to convince John of the error
of his ways, if John does not want to be convinced.”

How does any of that map on to the universalist position? Certainly your
position might be how Christ decides to operate, but he doesn’t seem to have
told his apostles or his Church in ecumenical councils that this was the way
he was going to do. So much for the apostolic traditio…

I don’t know of any way to frame the legit concerns on both sides without
endless qualification. Just because God is ‘free’ in the consummate sense of
being ‘unconstrained’ in the exercise of the love and goodness he is (and
cannot otherwise be) doesn’t itself mean there can be no conceivable occasion
wherein the exercise of his will is ‘equally good’ regardless of what he does,
and frankly I think his creating is just such an occasion. He can create
without opposition or the imposition of any necessity. Absolute dispositive
liberty. But absolute dispositive liberty includes the contrary choice too
where the exercise is not a moral act. And that the exercise of this liberty
is not a temporal event of becoming doesn’t empty the counterfactual ‘mode’ of
its relevance. But as always, I could be and probably am wrong.

It may also be worth reflecting on how Jesus’ opponents could have argued that
his commandment to “turn the other cheek” must be incorrect else it would mean
that God had led Israel into a “grave institutional error” in its teaching of
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”.

So we would know that if God did indeed directly create all beings into a
state of perpetual torture, that it would be good, as there would be a good
reason for it.

This is the first answer to my comments from you that I’m reading so perhaps
you’re answering that particular argument of mine in another one, but given
that statement I doubt it.  
In cases of rational considerations, there is always only one choice of
practical relevance; the one we’re acting on. Say we’re capable of saving our
spouse from an oncoming car. We got full rational clarity, there’s actually no
reason for us not to interfere. I concede that we have two options though,
either to interfere or not to. My claim now is that there is no possible world
in which we ever let it happen. That possibility is abstract and of no
practical relevance; there is no way to act rationally and come to a different
conclusion but that we interfere.

The firm Catholic teaching is that the Eucharist manifests the entirety of
Christ in his relationship with the Church: the nuptial of the Groom to the
Bride in the Wedding Feast of the Lamb, the sacred meal (Last Supper), the
sacrifice of Cavalry, the perfection of the ancient sacrifices of Abel and
Melchizedek and Abraham and Aaron, the gathering of the ecclesia in worship of
the Father through the sacramental signs as the Son offers himself to the
Father in one continuous act of love for the salvation of the world, the
conquering of sin and death, feeding the soul and restoring us to more perfect
union with God, anticipation of the Heavenly City, and so forth.

“My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is impossible
for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that proving this is
*necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Now I certainly understand why you deny that God is freely good. As I said
before, you are entitled to define the term “freedom” as you see fit, provided
that you continue to use this term consistently. But how can you not also
deny, if you want to remain consistent, that some of God’s good actions are
less than perfectly free? God was no doubt free (in your sense) not to promise
a son to Abraham and Sarah. But having made that promise, in what sense was he
then free not to provide the promised son? If you say, as you do, “God is not
free to perform an evil action, because those alternatives do not exist for
Him”; and if you also say that breaking his promise by not providing the
promised son would have been an evil act, then in what sense was God free with
respect to the good act of keeping his promise and providing the promised son?

In my article, I explicitly argued that God does act upon John in the
afterlife in aiming to bring John into contact with the truth about God’s love
for John. John does not respond to this love forever, given the state of
John’s will, and so this love causes John pain. This is, I’ve proposed, what
the ‘fire’ of hell consists in. On the one hand, it is true that John remains
free in hell and could have done otherwise than be in this state where his
will is resistant to God’s love; on the other hand, it is also true that
(given John’s state) nothing about God’s love is such as to efficaciously move
John’s will and so John will never leave that state.

You object to the claim that it is impossible for the Good to will anything
except the Good?

Provide explicit ideas which Goods could come from that, otherwise that
proposal is worthless fideism.

Father Rooney claims that his argument has nothing to do with any particular
metaphysics of freedom, though in the same breath he adds in the caveat of
“apart from” for elements of choice and decision associated with NINF. While
he may consider his assertions patently obvious and therefore uncontroversial,
they do in fact presume aspects that determine how one understands the nature
of freedom. Lots of folks pointed out how freedom as the flourishing of well-
being does not reduce to choice. Indeed, thinking of parental care and
compassion for the beloved as a decision is rather monstrous and existentially
false to human experience. One is simply not free to choose in the manner
proposed by NINF on matters of the most elemental intimacy. Loving action is
freedom. To choose contrary actions is irrational and an exercise in slavery
to delusion, disordered passion, etc. What it certainly is not is a licit
exercise of freedom. David Bentley Hart recently reprised Maximus the
Confessor’s view that Christ lacked a gnomic will. Perfected humanity does not
deliberate upon the Good. The horizon that makes our willing potentially
rational is completed by loving assent, not an endless choice of options that
might be otherwise. So, Fr. Rooney’s claims are question begging and far from
a benign expression of the obvious. Socratic method and the pedagogy of
Platonic dialogues is designed to point out aporias and undo the very
complacency that Fr. Rooney’s definition exemplifies.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no, I agree with that. Nevertheless, that premise is
unacceptable in the relevant case, because I argue that it’s impossible for a
completely rational soul to reject God, because the rational intellect
recognizes the fulfillment that can be found in him. You still need to provide
a way that the intellect might come to the conclusion that it would be
preferable to reject God, given the nature of him we agreed on. I still fail
to see how you come to the idea that this possibility should be affirmed.

If we did have to know all of God’s reasons for permitting every instance of
evil in order to be confident He was Good, we would be up sh*t creek, I’d
think. So, there are many reasons I am sure God has for various things that
happen in history, none of which I think anyone needs to know in order to that
God is good. That goes for God’s permission of moral evil, including mortal
sin.

So if I meaningfully choose to have someone push me down the stairs, among a
variety of actually live options, then that is a choice of mine. If I didn’t
have a choice then it wasn’t.

For your last point, Jesus’s perfection of the Old Law does not mean that “God
had led Israel into a grave institutional error”. Israel is not the Body of
Christ. God did not lead the Jewish people to have king instead of the Lord (1
Samuel 8:20). In the mystery of divine Providence God used this error of the
Jewish people themselves to bring about the Incarnation who would usher in the
Kingdom of God as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

This is simply a mare’s nest that masquarades as philosophical theology or
apologetics. To reject your NINF does not require determinism unless one
equates intellectual freedom as necessarily bound to the Good as a form of
determinism. In any concrete situation where deliberation normally applies, of
course one is dealing with any number of possible choices, but none of that
touches upon the metaphysical ground of freedom that makes choice a meaningful
act in the first place.

The contrary claim would be that the first sentence describes the state I’d
expect in heaven. And the possibility of the second claim I would object that
he then hasn’t made his love apparent at all. I can’t be held accountable for
not reflecting the love a distant acquaintance has for me, if she never makes
me know about it and I don’t know her enough to realize that she’s everything
I desire deep down. The possibility of rejecting him seems to require keeping
us in the dark. I don’t know which purpose that would serve, especially since
that would prevent us from fulfilling ourselves and God plays an active role
in that.

In the end, Rooney (and other infernalists) can, for various reasons, see (or
even imagine) the aesthetic beauty and goodness in (God’s allowing) ECT. For
me this cannot but constitute a defect of moral sensibility, and there’s no
equation or logic outside the sensibilities themselves that can demonstrate
this defect. It’s a matter of taste. I know people who think Grunge is
beautiful and Bach uninteresting, and others who prefer Thomas Kinkaid to
Vermeer or, for that matter, Turner. You just have to shake your head, but
there’s no dispassionate “math” as such, no logic outside the aesthetic, that
will prove the former wrong, because they’re aesthetically wrong. That’s not
to say there aren’t other sorts of arguments to be had. I’m just considering
what is for some the most powerful argument against ECT, the moral argument.

You have misunderstood the point. I claimed that being in “hell is not the
worst state of a person, since it is a place where God’s love is present and
God is doing what is best for someone, insofar as it is in God’s power to do
so….” So this was merely a comparative claim that the situation where someone
is suffering forever because of rejecting God, and where God is with them and
doing what He can for their good despite their rejecting that love, is better
than some other state. For example, I can imagine a state where God abandons
someone for eternity would be worse than the state I described. There might be
even worse states. We ought to be careful with claims that one or another
state is the worst or best. Similarly, my claim about the “worst possible
state” being non-existence was not to claim that this was *preferable* to
being in suffering, but merely to correct that non-existence is when nothing
is good or bad for you, and that seems the worst on a typical metaphysical
scale of evils as lacks or privations. But I am not thereby saying that
suffering forever is a great or stupendous sort of state, or that it is
preferable to non-existing.

Well, you know I agree. It comes back to your original point about aesthetic
taste (yes, Hart wrote an essay about it.) If the metaphysical structure of
desire is inescapably oriented towards the horizon of the Good, then there
cannot be a form of authentic willing that chooses evil for its own sake. I
think MacDonald said that the suicide does not want death, but more life.
Self-murder is really an attempt to escape circumstances that appear to
foreclose any possible hope. Even the desire for nothingness is the wish to
put a negative sign in front of the intolerable, not a refusal of genuine
well-being. Despondency is itself a “No” to the fallen world; the resignation
of despair a kind of hopeless hope, because the gift of existence is always
imbued with hidden grace. In addition to the sensibility factor, however, I
would add that if one understand Christ as the ground of Creation, it becomes
impossible to think any created being as “separate” from Christ. The teleology
of creatures is not only oriented towards the Good, but both protology and
eschatology manifest a rootedness in Christ that goes beyond a more general
metaphysics of dependence upon the Uncreated. One might further explore the
nature of Personhood, which I believe entails relation as much as “substance”
when determining what constitutes person. (Cf. Norris Clarke’s brief Person
and Being.) In short, why should one take Rooney’s limit of necessary, but not
sufficient concept of freedom as the criteria by which one should entertain
the proper disposition of souls for all eternity?

In terms of your worries that the Church has been in a “a rather grave
institutional error” for the past 2000 years, I’d point out that the
mainstream theological position of the Church these days appears to be
‘inclusivism’ – that many outside the visible walls of the Church and who do
not know Christ in this lifetime may yet be saved.

It seems likely, moreover, that neither God nor we humans typically make our
most important decisions in a context in which we could have acted otherwise.
As an illustration that takes us back to the issue of human freedom, consider
how C. S. Lewis described his own conversion to Christianity when he wrote:

I deny that definition of yours. Once again, I reject the distinction between
“love of God” and “desire for the good”, because it hinders the identification
of God with the Good. To claim that God can create a world in which people
might resist him, either falls into the case of taking advantage of ignorance
(the loving, unknown acquaintance) or logical impossibility. You definitely
have to explain the thought process that would go through the resisting soul,
even if it knows that all it ever strived for is right before its nose.
Otherwise that idea is worthless. To my mind, claiming that God can create a
being that wouldn’t love him, if it knows him, is like saying God can create a
being that isn’t existentially dependent on him.

But first some preliminary thoughts by way of preparation. Few Christians
would reject the idea that the perfected saints in heaven have indeed reached
a point where they could not do otherwise than obey the will of God and,
similarly, “could not do otherwise than love God.” They have achieved, after
all, a full clarity of vision concerning who God is, why he is the ultimate
source of human happiness, and why acting otherwise in such matters would be
utterly irrational and stupid. So is it Rooney’s view that the perfected
saints in heaven no longer obey God freely? If so, then many of those who
worry about heresy, as I do not, will no doubt regard him as a heretic; and if
not, then acting freely in a specific situation does not _always_ require that
one could have acted otherwise in that very same situation. As for those on
either side of the grave who are not yet perfected saints in heaven, the more
controversial issue, I suppose, is whether there could be a guarantee of some
kind that they will eventually become such? My own conviction that there is
indeed such a guarantee rests upon two assumptions: first, that moral freedom
requires a mini­mal degree of rationality, and second, that, for this very
reason, the idea of a free and fully informed decision to reject God and his
love for us represents a metaphysical impossibility.

Talbott is seeking clarification and precision. There was nothing in his tone
or nature of his argument that appears dismissive in my judgement. He is not
writing polemic. Regardless, if you presume ahead of time the traditional
“Catholic” view of hell, what’s the point of dialectical inquiry with those
who assert otherwise? In any event, I surmise Talbott is trying to open up
space that might make “redefinition towards common understanding” at least
plausible. Otherwise, your “serious discussion” rules out the opposing view
from the start by definition so that the exercise will never get beyond
initial premises.

Would you agree that, if someone pushes you down the stairs, that your falling
down the stairs counts as a free decision of yours? If so, why is that a free
decision? If not, why not?

“I’ve read some of your and others writings on Gehenna, and while I don’t find
it compelling (and indeed problematic that the Lord was only speaking
prophetically of some historical event concerning Jerusalem).”

Also, “that Rooney’s argument regarding who goes to “hell” suffers from a
fatal ambiguity” — I don’t think Fr. Rooney claims anyone in particular goes
to hell (as he uses the term in the conventional permanent sense). This seems
to be a basic gap in understanding with Fr Rooney’s critics, if I am reading
him accurately.

Perhaps you can explain what would differentiate a “universalist” liturgy from
any pious and devout Presbyterian or Lutheran or Baptist communion service,
which holds to a purely symbolic, non sacramental occasion of celebrating the
Lord and praising God by breaking bread and sharing the cup “in memory of Me”?
IOW, what is Christ *doing* at the universalist liturgy that demands the
liturgy itself if there is no forgiveness of sins, or dispensation of actual
sanctifying graces that only God can give?

Not that you asked me, Joe, and speaking just for myself, but I’ve come to see
how ‘logical possibility’ is itself defined God’s moral character. I know this
isn’t at all popular today. Philosophers define what’s logically possible as
any consistently meaningful state of affairs that does not, so far as we know,
generate a contradiction in its terms. So ‘married bachelors’ is out. But
‘unicorns’? Probably not. Eternal conscious torment? Or perhaps a conclusion
to God’s creative work in which none at all are finally saved? Not obvious
semantic conflicts. No contradiction of terms. And yet I

It seems to me that universalism calls into doubt, or raises serious
complications with Christology, ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and
liturgical theology. It is positing a whole different religion from the
conventional reading of apostolic Christianity.

And this is exactly where our disagreements are boiling down to and why I find
your position incredible. We can both agree that every aspect of a rational
human being is naturally drawn to God, in which the aspects of truth, goodness
and existence converge. It would be only in God that we would find our
ultimate fulfillment. God of course can only blame a being that made a fully
informed decision, otherwise it would be taking advantage of a state of
ignorance, something unworthy of the highest being. But that fully informed
state is comparable to the example with our spouse and the oncoming car. WHAT
ON EARTH could ever be the reason to reject God in a fully informed state?
Claiming that the rejection makes the human not any less rational seems like a
fullfledged contradiction. And in the example it can’t be clouded judgment
through any emotional state either, since we’re fully informed, UNLESS God
actually managed to create a being whose end is not found in him. But then the
punishment for rejection is unjustified. So to end my point here, I’ll do it
in the spirit of the maverick philosopher and formulate an aporetic tetrad:

I’m back in town again and have read your response to my latest post here. I
also sense that if I could better understand your opening sentences, then I
might better understand your overall position as well. You wrote: “I don’t see
that I am saying anything that affects whether God’s ‘most important actions’
are free. All I deny is that God is freely good, not that the actions He
performs which are good are less free.”

Rooney’s “unknown good” is pure smoke screen. It’s a poker’s bluff. It
wouldn’t matter if he were explicit as to what it was, for it is still (on
Rooney’s view as well) an ‘unnecessary and gratuitous good’ (Note: a “good,”
not just a sterile “logical possibility”) and THAT is the problem.

Oh, and that tears it, DBH is right. There is something deeply wrong with you,
and with any faith in which this could be considered an orthodox position. It
is impossible for God to have a good reason to will such an evil because God
is the Good and so can will only the Good for everything and everyone by his
very nature.

I am not unaware that union with God through grace is a great good, but even
this union comes in degrees. The Blessed Virgin shares far greater in the
grace of Christ than I or you possibly could. There is no uniquely greatest or
best degree of union with God, and so God does not ‘fail’ a person by not
elevating them to the degree of glory of the BVM, for example. Similarly for
creation. God could always create a better world. Both of these principles are
important because there are what we might call ‘kinds’ of worlds in which Gods
everything that is best for those in each world, but none of which is uniquely
the only best one. I am arguing that we have no reason to believe that a world
in which God has chosen to permit people to resist His love forever and so
permit hell – what I take to be the actual world – is not among those worlds
in which God is not doing what is best for those in the world. This is just
another way of saying God can have a good reason to permit hell. So, in sum, I
and the classical Christian tradition do not hold that God permits hell “for
no particular reason.” We instead think that God permits hell for only the
best sorts of reasons. And I’ve seen no valid and sound argument that it is
impossible for God to have such a good reason.

To paraphrase David Bentley Hart…  
“To fully see God’s love is to desire it insatiably, not to desire it is not
to have known it, and so never have been free to choose it.”

“On the contrary, NINF is supposed to hold in regard to what God does outside
of His own life—such as create the universe or redeem humanity—because these
are objects of His free choice. [God here does not act by deliberating, but He
nevertheless could have done otherwise than He did, and nothing about these
choices are such that God had to choose to do one or the other . . .”

We thus confront a choice between two very different explanations concerning
why nothing in creation could ever threaten God’s own happiness. We might
imagine, first of all, that God should be utterly indifferent and couldn’t
care less about the ultimate fate of created per­sons. But of course
indifference is just the opposite of any genuine love for another. So even
though I would never attribute to Rooney, without clearer evidence, the view
that God is utterly indifferent concerning the ultimate fate of human beings,
I would like to understand better his remark concerning communion within the
divine Trinity. For this remark could easily be interpreted as implying that
God’s happiness is logically consistent with just anything we might imagine
happening outside the sphere of that special communion. Anyway, an alternative
explanation of why nothing in creation could ever threaten God’s own happiness
does not reject the idea that he cares deeply about the ultimate fate of those
whom he has loved into existence in the first place. A Christian universalist
may thus hold that the God “who desires everyone to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4) and
“is not willing that any should perish but [wills instead] that all should
come to repent­ance” (2 Peter 3:9) never has the slightest doubt concerning
his ability to satisfy his own will or desire in this matter. For has he not
already arranged things so that “one righteous act resulted in justification
and life for all people” (Rom. 5:18b)?

Adopting, for the sake of argument, your use of ‘free’ . . . God freely loves
John into being, but then must love John, i.e. He is not free to choose to not
love John.

Hi Steven, for what regards the meaning and the meaningfulness of sacraments
when looked at from a universalist perspective, bearing in mind that all the
sacraments are grounded on the Eucharistic sacrament, I think you might find
the following article to be useful:  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/01/18/god-is-eucharistic-love-bulgakovs-
transvaluation-of-sacrifice/>

No, this is absolute nonsense. There is the Good and that which is united to
the Good and therefore perfect, and therefore not admitting of any better
world. There is a best world, your attempts to selectively spew relativistic
squid ink aside.

And I’ve shown that, while they are examples of instances where you cannot do
otherwise, they are not counter-examples to a principle like NINF because they
are either not free actions where you can’t have done otherwise (as in the
Father begetting the Son) or not where you can’t have done otherwise simply
(as in the saints). Thus, they do not show that the necessary condition I’m
proposing is false.

1\. People can want things that do not correspond to what they ought to want
(and do not necessarily or by nature want to love God).  
2\. Learning new facts about the world, God, or yourself need not change what
you want.  
3\. God does not need to change what you want.

3\. By ‘accepting the first fork,’ I refer to what you seemed to accept in the
claims about God’s interests being tied to those of His creatures, discussed
in 4.

Here Fr. Rooney clearly infers that some will mistakenly choose hell as an
existence securing their own happiness even though it brings them suffering.
Here, Fr. Rooney is clearly contrasting happiness with suffering. (They choose
to believe it will make them happy even though it won’t.) However, Fr. Rooney
then goes on to assert that those in hell will love the pain because they love
pain. This is the same pain which Fr. Rooney has just defined as the
antithesis of happiness. But Fr. Rooney contends that they will choose eternal
suffering rather than God’s love because their love is incompatible with love
of God.

Now of course, a 21st century Catholic priest knows more about early
universalism than St Augustine, St Jerome and St Basil of Caesarea.  
Yes, yes… Makes perfect sense.

I wrote my response before I read yours. You said it so much better! You and
Brian are brilliant, as usual.

Since the possibility that all may be saved is uncontroversial, one might ask
if this outcome represents a greater manifestation of goodness than its
alternative. You write that it is improper to conceive of one outcome as
“better” than another, but I find this strange and unpersuasive. Contrary to
this odd sentiment, you write, “I think it is perfectly legitimate to hope in
God’s goodness that He might save all.”

And sorry – just realised I’ve done this twice now – Steven, not Stephen! 🙂

“There are lots of people, for all I know, who do not love God and are living
in mortal sin at the present.”

I am only arguing that it is impossible to show that it could not be possible
God might have a good reason to allow people to resist His love forever.

But you are quite right that this dispute is largely a question of ‘taste’
insofar as universalists think that they can conclude God could not permit
anyone to be lost merely on the basis of their imagination as to what God’s
reasons are like. To think one gets that kind of wide-ranging knowledge of all
logical possibilities of what God’s reasons could be like (that one needs in
order to be a universalist) from your intuition (or sensibility or
imagination) is very implausible. I do not think we should accept that the
limitations of our imagination are the limitations of the real.

Why should the universalist Orthodox even think that what the Orthodox Church
teaches about the sacrificial meaning of the Eucharist, and the Eucharistic
meaning of sacrifice, is true and entails that it should continue to be
*offered* at the Divine Liturgy (except for some scriptural and traditional
notion that we should come together weekly to break the bread)?

But at this point too, Kenanada, you seem to be right. It really does come
down to one’s moral sense/imagination, something one sees or doesn’t see. I
don’t think Fr Rooney really “sees” the goodness of God’s freely creating on
the condition that some are eternally lost (by whatever means) to suffer
without him. I think he believes he has to believe this, and what imposes that
sense of necessity upon him also determines and shapes his own sense of faith
and belonging.

According to the article I shared, having a choice among possibilities is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for any theologically adequate
understanding of freedom (TAUF).

Rooney also owes us some additional clarity on his own understanding of such
concepts as that of _freedom_ , _free choice_ , and _free will_. In the first
sentence of the above quotation as well as elsewhere, he at least _appears_ ,
once again, to identify doing something freely with a power to act otherwise.
He then declares, “Universalism would not be true without denying either human
freedom in salvation or divine freedom in creation or redemption.” But so
what? All I ask for at this point is a bit of clarity from Rooney concerning
his own use of the term “freedom” and its implications. If he wants to use
this term in such a way that one acts freely only when, at the time of acting,
one also has a power to act otherwise, then I will gladly accept this as a
stipulation. For we are all free to stipulate a specific meaning for some
technical term we are using, although we must also be clear about its
implications. One implication of Rooney’s apparent stipulation is this: if a
young mother, filled with love for her newborn baby, finds it utterly
unthinkable (and therefore psycho­log­ically impossible) to abandon her baby
and not to take care for it, then she does not take care of her baby freely in
the above stipulated sense. But again I ask, “So what?” There are many other
conceptions of freedom—including libertarian conceptions, I might
add4—according to which our young mother does indeed take care of her baby
freely. So to repeat the point, all we need here is a bit of clarity
concerning the meaning and the implications of the basic terms we are using.

(3) Rooney also claims that I accept “the first fork: arguing that God’s
decision to save all human beings is a necessary fact about God’s nature, so
that God could not choose to do otherwise.” But this is just one more
imprecision. If it is not a “necessary fact about God’s nature” that he
creates human beings in the first place, as Rooney himself insists and I am
willing to concede for the sake of argument, then neither is it a “necessary
fact about God’s nature” that he saves non-existent humans from non-existent
sins.

Finally, against any suggestion that communion within the Trinity could render
God indifferent to the fate of those others whom he has loved into existence,
I would argue that the truth is just the opposite of that. The following
analogy is no doubt flawed in many ways, but it nonetheless points in the
direction of an important truth. Suppose that a young married couple have an
absolutely fulfilling love relationship with each other, and suppose further
that their relationship would remain altogether fulfilling even if they never
have children together. They enjoy hiking together in the mountains, joking
around with each other and their friends, and just being in each other’s
presence. Still, if they do have a child together and continue to love that
child with all their heart, then their happiness cannot remain consistent with
just anything that might happen to that child. Similarly, even if God’s
happiness is consistent with his choosing not to create anything at all, his
decision to create additional persons to love automatically changes the
situation he faces in this respect: his supreme happiness is no longer
consistent with just anything we might imagine happening in his creation. Yes,
there is an important disanalogy in the present context between our example of
loving parents and the Trinitarian God of Christianity. For however loving a
pair of human parents may be, they will have far less control over the
ultimate fate of their child than an omnipotent and omniscient God would have
over the ultimate fate of his creation. But that merely underscores the point
that, unlike a pair of human parents, God’s own happiness is never vulnerable
to conditions over which he has no control at all.

As I said above, I think the arguments for or against this regard the moral
sensibilities and thus are aesthetic in nature. There’s no syllogism whose
terms are all defined and apprehended with dispassionate logical precisely
that clinches the argument this way or that. The Moral Argument is at the
heart of all DBH’s other arguments functioning as a kind of ‘mindset’ of
‘value set’ that can’t finally be divorced from the other arguments.

Joe: God may permit people to eternal torment and if he does, there must be a
good reason because, by definition, everything that God does is good.
Therefore, permitting everlasting torture must be good, even if the goodness
of this can never be demonstrated in any way

The only thing that breaks the stalemate is the realization that only one of
these scenarios aligns with God’s moral character.

“In the next life, it remains possible for God to convince John of the error
of his ways. Because He loves John, God will continue trying to convince John
of the error of his ways. If John were convinced, his post-mortem suffering
would end.”

These “limits” you posit are wholly arbitrary, moreover they are completely
incompatible with the idea of predestination at all. God is not limiting
anything, he is actively and maliciously choosing to to ship people on a
conveyor belt to hell for literally no reason before they were born.

But I’m psychoanalyzing, and that’s not fair. Sorry. Anyhow, Fr Rooney is
making a ‘moral’ claim, not a purely ‘logical’ one. And being a moral claim, a
large part of how that’s resolved really does depend on one’s moral sense or
aesthetic ‘taste’.

What in the world is this nonsense? Of course there is a best state for any
individual, are you lying or have you simply forgotten the basic premises of
your own religion? That which is the best is the state which is united with
the Good. So obviously there is indeed such a best state for any individual,
or for all of creation.

For both the Eastern and Western apostolic traditions, the Eucharist is
certainly the perfect and complete sacrament of Christ himself, both priest
and victim, body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus who makes himself
present under the sacramental signs. All the sacraments are “one” in the sense
that it is always Christ acting to bring healing and sanctifying and uniting
grace to the soul, and all are true participation in some aspect of his
sacrificial, kenotic death and resurrection to overcome sin and death, and to
restore the soul to grace.

God cannot “permit” anything. Everything is totally dependent on God. That’s
also the reason why God does not react to something that happens in the world.
Your god is too small …

Now against this understanding of divine freedom, which Lewis appears to share
with Hart, Rooney argues as follows:

So that brings us to my second assumption above. Are there cogent reasons for
believing that a free and fully informed decision to reject God forever
represents a metaphysical impos­si­bil­ity? Of course there are. Even C. S.
Lewis, despite his own defense of a free-will theodicy of hell, once offered
support for this assumption, perhaps unknowingly, when he wrote concerning the
divine nature that “union with that Nature is bliss and separation from it [an
objective] horror.”2 Suppose, then, that we think of the outer darkness as a
biblical image of separation from the divine nature as far as this is possible
short of annihilation; suppose further that we think of such separation from
every implicit experience of God as something akin to a soul suspended alone
in sheer nothingness, without even a physical order to experience. If that
would be an objective horror, as Lewis insisted, then it would explain why no
minimally rational person could _both_ experience this objective horror _and_
continue to embrace it freely. It would also explains how God could shatter
all of the illusions and self-deceptions that might make a life apart from God
seem desirable and how he could do so without in any way interfering with our
freedom to separate ourselves from him. For it is precisely when we exercise
that very freedom and when God permits us to experience the very life we have
confusedly chosen for ourselves that we begin to experience, and finally to
discover, its horrific nature. Just as no one (with a normal nervous system)
who is rational enough to qualify as a free moral agent could both shove an
unprotected arm into a hot fire and retain an illusion that this fire causes
sensations of intense pleasure, neither could such a person both experience
the outer darkness and retain forever the illusion that some other imagined
condition, such as submission to God, would be even worse than this.

You are way too wrapped up in whatever led you to your position (I read for
instance your Little Jimmy story, which is on the literary and theological
level of Jack Chick), to have any sense of balance in interpreting
Catholicism. I take it you’re an ex-Catholic and somehow you’re working
through what you self describe as “Having been terrorized by such teaching for
over 50 years, I am fed up with the angry God of Roman Catholicism”? I’m
deeply sorry for whatever you’ve been through, and can only wish you peace and
healing. But you have not supported your accusations with any evidence as to
what the Catholic Church teaches about God.

Part of the issue here is whether there are limits of any kind to the range of
_possible_ free choice. Although Rooney seems to identify moral freedom with
the power to act otherwise, as we have seen, it is easy enough to imagine
cases where someone has such a power and yet remains too irrational to qualify
as being morally responsible for his or her actions. Suppose, by way of
illustration, that a schizophrenic young man should kill his loving mother,
believ­ing her to be a sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother,
and suppose further that he does so in a context in which he categorically
could have chosen otherwise (in part, perhaps, because he worries about
possible retaliation from other sinister space aliens). Why should such an
irrational choice, even if not causally deter­mined, be any more compatible
with genuine moral freedom than a rigorous determinism would be? Either our
seriously deluded beliefs, particularly those with destructive consequences in
our own lives, are in principle correctable by some degree of powerful
evidence against them, or the choices that rest upon them are simply too
irrational to qualify as free moral choices.

(1) Rooney writes, “Talbott and many others reject the charge of heresy . . .”
But in fact I do not reject that charge, given Rooney’s own conception of what
counts as heresy. Indeed, my most relevant comment about heresy in my original
piece was that “many of those who worry about heresy, as I do not . . .” So in
case that wasn’t clear enough, let me here concede that I am no doubt a
heretic, given Rooney’s understanding of that term. But so what? I would argue
that St. Paul clearly delivered a universalist message and was therefore a
heretic in Rooney’s sense of the term; and Rooney himself may also be a
heretic, given some other understanding of that term. So again I ask, “Why
should anyone care about that?

Prescinding from the question of which (if either) is “true”, the rupture or
volte-face and its wider implications must be at least acknowledged.

I think this debate is really about God’s character. For many years, I was
afraid to look at the Deity behind the curtain because He might not only be
terrifying but also deeply disappointing. As I have grown in my faith, I
believe that the God who will divulge Himself in His final judgment will truly
be the Father that Jesus revealed. I believe God is love and His goodness will
be apparent to all. Who you believe God is changes everything.

Brian, didn’t your comment have to do with divine agency (its determination,
freedom, character, etc)? I thought so.

Finally, we need to distinguish. Nobody chooses eternal suffering for its own
sake, including people in hell. They choose what they believe will make them
happy – even though it, in fact, will bring them eternal suffering because
what they love is incompatible with love of God. Suffering is thus, as it
were, accidental to and not essential to the object of their love. But there
is no reason that they cannot continue to love that thing which brings them
pain indefinitely, precisely because they love it. And I would suggest desire
to be annihilated rather than exist is the same kind of failure to love
appropriately which characterizes despair – a kind of pride or inappropriate
love of self – rather than love of God. God does not agree, as I see it, that
it would be better to let anyone commit suicide. Thus, their failure is not on
God’s part, since He has not done anything to hurt them, and He remains with
and beside them even in the midst of their despair. This is the way in which
God does what is best for them even when they turn against His love.

“But, as you might recall from my CLJ article, I explicitly and repeatedly
argue that this assumption is false or at least can be rejected by defenders
of the orthodox picture of hell. On that picture (held by the Catholic and
Orthodox tradition), Calvinistic theological determinism is false, and God
does nothing to make it the case that anyone goes to hell, neither causing
them to resist His love eternally nor denying them something without which
they could not avoid ending up in hell.”

As to Brad’s questions: “God freely loves John into being, but then must love
John, i.e. He is not free to choose to not love John.”

This doesn´t work though, especially given that the beings in hell made a
rational decision against that particular creature you´re describing here. A
rational decision is always dependent on the type of information available,
weight in such a way that we can deduce which options leads us to the Good.
Once again, past remarks of yours have lead us to the same route, your
conception prevents the identification of “God” with the Good, making “God”
irrelevant in our spiritual quest. An act with the explicit desire for the
greatest own good, which, given our natural will is always directed towards
the Good, can hardly be sinful, let alone be a mortal sin, even if its against
God. If God is the Good, that would be his fault then, in the case of a
completely rational soul. If it were to see the Good completely, it´s
impossible for it to not be drawn to it.

If you agree with that claim, you would affirm – with me, against Talbott –
that it is possible to make yourself a slave to sin. If you hold Talbott’s
position, it is metaphysically impossible for someone to make themselves
slaves to sin.

Does your position imply that the institutional Church is no longer necessary?
That would be one not unreasonable inference.

“Strange ideas which have neither support from Scripture, nor the Fathers, nor
Holy Tradition”.

While I think there’s a legit concern in counterfactual “power to the
contrary” language regarding God’s creating, expressing it is littered left
and right with land minds. There’s no way to describe it as ‘libertarian’ in
the only sense we know of a counterfactual power to the contrary. But denials
of counterfactual claims and assertions that God creates ‘necessarily’ are not
without their own land minds.

So just how should we understand Rooney’s claim here? Is he claiming that
God’s eternal happiness is logically consistent with just anything that
someone might imagine happening to his creatures? Suppose that a religious
alien from Alpha Centauri should declare that all Christians, including
Rooney, will burn eternally in hell for their blasphemy in accepting the
Christian faith; and suppose further that our alien “friend” should then
remind us that God’s own happiness does not depend causally on anything that
actually happens in his creation. This might seem like a neat trick if it
could fool some into believing, contrary to numerous biblical texts, that God
cares nothing about what actually happens to his creatures. But that would
also be sheer confusion. For once again, it is precisely God’s eternal
happiness together with his essential goodness that _determines_ the very
nature of his providential control over his creation. And this explains, in
particular, why God would never permit irreparable harm—that is, harm that not
even omnipotence could repair at some future time—to befall one of his own
loved ones. It also explains why certain conceptions of hell, including that
of our imagined alien, would be logically inconsistent with God’s own
happiness _and_ essential goodness.

That was my point. For any false belief X, the believer of X, given their
formation, could not have done otherwise than believe X. Put another way, no
one believes a falsehood willingly. And any bad action Y is done on the basis
of some false belief. Does it follow that no one is culpable for Y? It
certainly does, if we understand culpability the way you do. To be culpable is
to be deserving of ‘punishment’, and on the infernalist idea of punishment, to
be culpable is to be deserving of retribution, i.e. harm for the sake of harm.
But this notion of punishment requires that Y be done with full freedom, which
in turn requires full knowledge (cf. Section 1857 of the Catechism of the
Catholic Church), and therefore a rejection of X as false. But if X were
rejected, then Y would not be done. Thus, the same point is made from the
other direction.

It seems to me that Fr. Rooney defeats his own argument by maintaining that
the rejection of God’s love in the Christian story must be fully informed.

All the above and more all held as consensus in the Roman Catholic Church –
while we Orthodox look askance at their strange ideas which have neither
support from Scripture, nor the Fathers, nor Holy Tradition.

‘Directly creates and sustains’ seems an odd presumption. On the orthodox
picture, God merely permits hell. That’s not to directly create or sustain.
But I was talking about learning that hell is really possible, as we might in
revelation from God, not merely that someone asserts it does.

Now finally, Rooney interprets one of Hart’s arguments against an everlasting
hell, perhaps the most persuasive one of them all in my opinion, as follows:

Anything can be good; anything can be justified; anything can be Holy. The
seemingly most depraved human acts may in fact be exemplary instances of this
mysterious “unknown good” in history. Honestly, how could you know? The
bedrock of moral action crumbles into dust.

Fr. Rooney is part of a coterie of priests and laity who become apoplectic
when they read the idea that God has the salvation of all – indeed, the
restoration of all things – as His will and shall accomplish it. Their whole
existence seems to be a determination to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that
hell exists, it is forever, and it is totally loving and just of God to send
souls there, even though He foreknew of the fall of man and the result it
would bring.

I must confess that these remarks make no sense to me at all. If it is a
logical (or meta­phys­ical) necessity that God keeps whatever promises he
makes, then it is also a logical necessity that his reasons for keeping a
given promise (assuming he makes one) will always outweigh whatever reasons
may exist for breaking it. But how on earth does that make God’s goodness
dependent on the very reasons for which his own moral perfection is
responsible?—and how on earth does it make his goodness “dependent on
creation”? What, in other words, is the relevant conception of _dependence_
here? According to the traditional doctrine of _divine aseity_ , neither God’s
necessary existence nor his essential goodness is c _ausally dependent_ upon
(or a causal effect of) anything that happens in his creation; all relations
of causal dependence go in the opposite direction. But whatever one might
otherwise think of this doctrine, in no way is it inconsistent with there
being a host of logical (or metaphysical) necessities and impossibilities,
grounded in God’s self-sufficiency and essential perfections, concerning how
he would providentially care for any created loved ones, if there should be
any. When Rooney declares, “Necessitating God’s choices is problematic because
it implies that God’s goodness is dependent on creation or what he does,” he
therefore owes us something more than a bald assertion at this point. For as
any perfect being theist would insist, he has it exactly backwards here. It is
precisely the necessity of God’s goodness that actually _determines_ some of
his actions in creation—that he never breaks a promise, for example—so that
his actions in relation to his creation are themselves dependent upon the
nature of his goodness, not _vice versa_.

Everyone admits that God can only will the Good. The question is whether God
permitting someone to resist His love forever can possibly be for the good. If
it were possible for the permission of hell to be part of God’s good plan,
then ‘hard universalism’ is false. It would be false that God can do nothing
other than save all people, even if it were actually the case that God saves
all mankind.

I am sure I could find more in the writings of some of the Fathers. There is a
stream of consciousness in the Western mind that was formed in the Roman
Empire and has lasted to this day in the Western theological arena. Simply
put, Western soteriology is concerned with sinners getting a beating –
forever! This is not the mind of the Eastern Church.

But I do remember not long ago I did defend ECT, and like Fr Rooney, I
defended it for basically the same reasons. I think back on those days and
scratch my head.

1) It is possible for an individual to reject God  
2) If God is rejected, it must be done in a completely rational and culpable
state.  
3) In God there is the final fulfillment for every possible individual.

Now of course Christ can save any and all without the sacraments, but the
conventional narrative is that Christ established the Church as a material
hierarchical institution to gather the nations under his lordship, which
involves the proclamation of the Gospel and the administration of the
sacraments for the reconciliation of the world to the Father. The Church is
rather firm in upholding that baptism is the necessary and ordinary means for
the soul to be cleansed of sin and made worthy of the sacraments, and that the
sacraments are ordained for the sanctification and salvation of the faithful.

It wouldn’t be legitimate to hope in this outcome if this outcome wasn’t
better than any other. It is not only inarguably better, it is the best
outcome. And what makes this outcome self-evidently better? Because it
represents a greater outpouring of divine goodness. When this self-evident
knowledge (salvation of all as the greatest outcome) is coupled with its
possibility, we are left with an outcome of which one can be certain, insofar
one can be certain of anything.

“If we did have to know all of God’s reasons for permitting every instance of
evil in order to be confident He was Good, we would be up sh*t creek, I’d
think.”

“Do you think that, knowing God is Good, there is no possible way for Him to
bring good from eternal resistance of some to His love?”

“you continue to miss or ignore the provisional nature of the freedom you
assert. Fully realized freedom actually makes the kind of choice you posit
disappear in favor of perfect willing of the Good.”

I would tell the pineapple story a different way. If we have a perfect farmer,
capable of recognizing the potential of each seed, then he will be able to see
what the particular one needs to grow into a pineapple, since every obstacle
to that end would be a removable accident. I don’t think I will have to
explain what my inference from that would be.

I also want to commend you on your irenic and charitable disposition toward
all here, and for facilitating an important if difficult conversation.

And just so that you know that I am an equal opportunity insulter, here’s a
Protestant minister exalting in the fiery torment of the sinners:

Catholic efforts to turn Mary into the fourth person of the Trinity aside, no
she doesn’t. If Mary is in fact a human woman with a human nature, then there
is no degree of grace in principle attainable to her that would not also be
attainable to others. Also the idea that there could be “degrees” to that
which is by its nature infinite is risible.

John Milbank uses the same word “simple” to sum up his defense of
apokatastasis.  
“It’s simple. God is good. Being good he freely creates a good Creation.
Inexplicably his Creation turns to evil. Since God is good, he rescues and
restores it. Both the creation and the restoration are fusedly gift, sacrifice
and manifestation.”

I confess that until yesterday evening I have not been following the
conversations in this combox. I am disappointed in the level of polemic and ad
hominem. Stop it now!

I forgot to address the claim about ambiguity. Consider ‘John freely chooses
to be a human being.’ If this means that John chose to be a human being, then
it would be nonsense. John’s choice would not have mattered one way or
another; it was not an object of John’s choice to be human or not. If this
means that John chose to act as a human being should, e.g., ‘humanely’ or
‘well’, or that John willingly wants to be a human being (rather than, e.g.,
commit suicide), then the phrase makes sense. I am applying a similar
distinction with God. If ‘God freely chooses not to lie to Abraham’ means that
God chose to be the kind of thing that does not lie, and to be the kind of
thing that keeps His promises, then the claim is nonsense. God’s choice is not
what makes the divine nature unable to lie. If ‘God freely chooses not to lie
to Abraham’ means that God chose to swear an oath to Abraham even though He
could have done otherwise, or kept His word willingly (not, as if, by force),
then of course such a claim is true.

Logically, if the “worst possible state” for a given substance is X, then
literally any other state must – by definition – be a preferable state of
affairs to X for that substance.

Thanks for your responses. Before I head off to enjoy a day of turkey, pie,
football and thanksgiving, I have a further question about one of your
answers.

Theological determinism is a logical necessity of the propositions you have
already accepted. That you don’t wish to acknowledge that is not my problem.

Perhaps in that sphere — the nature of the choice by which one lands oneself
in Hell and how that choice (or that history of choices) ends up foreclosing
upon one’s future – sure. Let’s say that’s broadly logical. But as to the
morality of God’s determination to create such a world to begin with, that’s a
moral judgment. And if one views the divine determination to create such a
world as morally unimaginable, any subsequent arguments designed to make sense
of the ‘supposed possible world’ don’t have any purchasing power morally
speaking. They’re just word games within a fantasized movie.

So Fr. Rooney asserts that the best God can do for a person in hell is to stay
with them while they suffer eternal torment. Apparently, God is out of
options. Like a mother who holds the hand of her terminally ill child. There
is nothing more He can do. An omnipotent Creator comes face to face with a
dilemma of His own making. God’s will is now subjugated to the volition of His
child and can now only watch as the loved one He has breathed life into
suffers unimaginable pain forever and forever – mirroring the remaining
timeline of His own existence. One might imagine such a God suffering from
Creation regret. “What have I done?”

Ridiculous? I would ask Rooney, can he demonstrate that it is “impossible that
this is not possible”?

That’s somehow really helpful! Thanks a lot! 🙂 (even though I wonder if things
work in the same way also for Catholics…)

Either our rational telos is directed towards God or it isn´t. If it isn´t,
we´ll have to find our destination elsewhere, God punishing us for that would
just be him getting in our way to our ultimate fulfillment. That´s hardly a
Christian perspective though, and would make God not only quite irrelevant,
but also not perfectly good.

You don’t have to buy my intuition, though, as here’s an argument this
consequence is bad, if you admit that we cannot have controlled the facts of
the past or laws of nature (‘the course of the cosmos’):

But as I don’t agree with your premise, I don’t agree that the apostolic
Church(es) are embracing “inclusivism” to the rejection of the need for the
person to encounter Christ, to be baptized into the Body of Christ, to be born
of the water and the spirit, to repent and believe in the Gospel, to worship
the Lord in spirit and in truth, to eat of His Body and drink of his Blood,
and to confess one’s sins, to serve the poor and the widows and orphans, to
clothe the naked and visit the prisoner and feed the hungry, etc. The Church
still teaches that Christ is still and forever the way, the truth, and the
life: if that is not the limit to “inclusivism” then there is no need for the
Church. This seems to be the position of the universalist, no?

“Within these limits, God still would be doing what is best even for the
damned, insofar as it is within His power to do what is best for them despite
their everlasting resistance to His love.”

So in essence the argument is: God may permit people to eternal torment and if
he does, there must be a good reason because, by definition, everything that
God does is good. Therefore, permitting everlasting torture MUST be good, even
if the goodness of this can never be demonstrated in any way. And furthermore,
its rationality and goodness need not be demonstrated. And all of you people
here at EO cannot prove that it is “impossible that this is possible.”

I think this gets at the nature of the moral sensibilities and intuitions that
inform Hart’s Moral Argument and Rooney’s rejection of it. In an important
sense, one either “sees it” or one doesn’t. Rooney doesn’t. He can imagine a
good (not ‘know’ what that good is, just ‘imagine’ that it is) which would
justify the free and unnecessary creation of a world that includes the
irrevocable loss and suffering of beloved creatures.

It is perfectly possible to believe that the sacraments are the normative
means by which God seeks to save all people, but still hold that God can and
does save people in other ways. I think you admit that this is possible, but
think it unlikely given it doesn’t appear to be part of the apostolic
tradition. But I would dispute this. The story of the harrowing of hell, which
we have discussed, is one clear example of God saving souls outside the
visible church. Jesus’ promise to the good thief that he would “see him this
day in paradise” is another one. The ‘baptism of blood’ tradition in the days
of the martyrs is another.

“It would be impious, I suppose, to suggest that, in his final divine judgment
on his creatures, God will judge himself; but one must hold that by that
judgment God will truly disclose himself (which, of course, is to say the same
thing, in a more hushed and reverential voice).”

Hi Father Rooney. It’s always interesting to read your reflections and
understand your position better, so thank you for recording your thoughts
here.

And, no, I deny that our actions under grace, including conversion, are
unfree. It is false that someone acting under grace, including that which
causes them to convert, simply cannot do otherwise. (I’d point out that this
claim about being able to resist God’s grace, even when being moved by God to
convert, is Catholic doctrine defined at Trent and that Thomist Banezians
always affirmed this too, precisely to safeguard that doctrine). Similarly,
this is not a ‘libertarian’ claim that moral freedom is the power of ‘contrary
choice.’ I merely affirmed that a choice is not free if it could not have been
otherwise simply speaking, since I already denied in some cases – such as the
saints in heaven – that one needs alternative possibilities open to one at all
times in order for a choice to be free. ‘NINF’ was a necessary condition, not
a sufficient one.

I think Charles Hartshorne (wonderful American philosopher and Process theist)
said metaphysical and logical possibility ultimately converge, and God’s
abiding loving nature defined the scope of those possibilities. I always
thought this made sense. It doesn’t make sense, for example, to suppose God’s
failing to desire or will the highest good of a creature is ‘logically
possible’. No meaningful state of affairs is being posited when what one
posits would require a failure of God to be God in order to bring it about.
Still, philosophers love to talk of ‘possible worlds’ and multiply them
without end. But as a believer in a benevolent God whose goodness and
benevolent nature cannot fail to be the origin and end of all meaning and all
actualizable possibilities, I cannot concede the logical possibility of what
is morally unimaginable to ascribe to God.

To be perfectly clear, my analysis holds yours, but isn’t reducible to yours.

Even though exceedingly difficult, one can at least imagine how temporary evil
may have some instrumental allowance, even if the precise details cannot be
known. But one can imagine this precisely because such suffering is temporary.
Eternal suffering on the other hand can have no instrumental purpose. It is
its own end.

I concur entirely, Tom, though I still think Nietzsche is one of the few
philosophers who manages to write interesting prose. I’d also as corollary
return to one of my abiding concerns. I’ve pointed out before how the same
folks who complacently assent to a notion of the victory of the gospel that
includes ECT tend to easily accept the notion that the suffering of particular
animals is justified as a necessary evil that makes possible the overall
beauty of the world. Thus, the lion must devour the antelope in order to have
such a thing as a lion. This is analogous to Fr. Rooney’s sensibility that
says the good of this world simply must allow that some folks will fail to
respond to God’s love for all eternity. In either case, a certain amount of
“collateral damage” is admitted into the perfection of the eschaton. Hart
rightly says that heaven is then built on a foundation of this “residue” of
unending suffering — and it doesn’t matter if a damaged soul were to be
conceived as “choosing” its own suffering, the objective truth of the person
is not mitigated by delusion. Back to animals, who as a misanthrope I find it
much easier to worry about — the blithe disregard for the particular suffering
of unique creatures is tremendously callous. Beyond its insensitivity,
however, it understands Creation as fundamentally oriented towards types
rather than uniquely irreplaceable beings. Peruse Virginia’s Woolf’s essay
“Death of a Moth” for a moving example of how style and discernment go hand-
in-hand.

I would like to see this argument continue without unnecessary doctrinal and
terminological baggage (e.g., instead of presuming the reality of Mortan Sin,
discuss the potential for one to act in manners that would necessarily or
justifiably result in their final alienation from God).

“The economics of the exchange is really quite monstrous. We can all
appreciate, I imagine, the shattering force of Vanya’s terrible question to
Alyosha in The Brothers Karamazov: If universal harmony and joy could be
secured by the torture and murder of a single innocent child, would you accept
that price? But let us say that somehow, mysteriously—in, say, Zosima’s
sanctity, Alyosha’s kiss, the million mile march of Vanya’s devil, the callous
old woman’s onion—an answer is offered that makes the transient torments of
history justifiable in the light of God’s everlasting Kingdom. But eternal
torments, final dereliction? Here the price is raised beyond any calculus of
relative goods, and into the realm of absolute—of infinite—expenditure.”

Plus I’m guessing that by saying the wicked person “is in hell freely” he only
means to describe the liberty of choice that got the wicked person there. He
doesn’t think the wicked person remains ‘free in hell’ to do other than reject
and curse God. Whatever free choice he had was spent and the will is now
irreversibly fixed, solidified/habituated in evil.

This leads to another question (my apologies for my ignorance of the
universalist answer) about grace itself: the apostolic orthodox position is
that the sacraments provide the soul with sanctifying grace: the sacraments
are instituted by Christ to confer sanctifying grace, especially baptism and
by extension the sacrament of confession to bring to sanctification and
salvation.

Fr. Rooney contends that…  
“…acting as a responsible and rational person does not require having perfect
knowledge of what is in my best interest. One does not need ‘good reason’…to
act in a way for which one is morally responsible. Human moral responsibility
only requires knowing ‘well-enough.’ …The kind of ignorance that undermines my
culpability is only that ignorance…such that my choice was such that I could
not have done anything to rectify that ignorance.”

You assert that. I deny it and have offered arguments that this is false,
specifically, because it relies on equivocation. Nobody here denies one is
‘more free’ in loving God, in the telological sense of ‘more’. What I deny is
that being a slave to sin is situation you arrive in without having been able
to do otherwise and for which you were not morally responsible.

We can always be more confident, as Christians, that God is Good than of any
evidence in favor of any instance of evil we see or experience being pointless
or meaningless. So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good
reasons for permitting it. I am merely applying this hopeful reasoning to the
case where we discover that God made it possible for us to resist His grace
forever. Then, I’d think, we come to know that God did this for a good reason
and I’d be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even
when if I were unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing
so. This is also, incidentally, why I have no problem with a hope that God
might save all – for all we know, He might! The heretical view, I argue, is
the claim that we know that God does save all, insofar as it is necessarily
true that universal salvation occurs.

They might be taken as kisses from the Beloved to His beloveds. The value of
those kisses need not be grounded on something else that they might be
instrumental for. They might be taken as ways for the Lord to be intimate with
us in the damaged world and damaged condition we are in.  
The reason why I thought that article to be helpful is because there Bulgakov
proposes to ground the meaning of the Eucharist ultimately on the Last Supper
itself, in the gratuitous, peaceful and bloodless gift of His Body and Blood
offered by the Christ to His disciples in that occasion. It is not the gift in
the Last Supper that should be understood in terms of the violent sacrifice of
His Death on the Cross, but the gift of His Death on the Cross that should be
understood in terms of the peaceful and nonviolent gift offered to His
beloveds at the Last Supper for the sake of loving His beloveds.  
I thought this way of understanding the Eucharist, the Last Supper and the
Cross would be available also for Catholics.  
Am I in error about that? If that were the case, please accept my apology.

So is my claim here that any temporary harm or hardship that befalls one of my
own loved ones would inevitably undermine my own happiness? Of course not! I
would at least hope that I could experience directly many instances of
temporary harm and hardship without losing a more basic sense of serenity. But
even if I should fail in this regard, many of the saints among us would not;
and the real issue comes down to whether one can sincerely believe that all
will be well in the end. So let us now suppose that I should discover that
some version of the doctrine of everlasting conscious torment should actually
be true and that my own daughter was destined for such an end. Even if such a
supposition expresses a logical impossibility, as I believe it does, we can at
least _imagine_ it being true. Suppose, then, that I should discover, to my
horror, that my daughter had indeed come to such a terrible end. Even if I
were to discover that, _by her own will_ , she had made herself intolerably
evil, I would still experience this as a terrible tragedy and an unacceptable
loss, one for which no compensation is even conceivable. Is it any wonder,
then, that Paul could say concerning his unbelieving kin whom he loved so
dearly, “For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ
for the sake of my people” (Romans 9:3)? From the perspective of his love, in
other words, Paul’s own damnation would be no worse an evil, and no greater
threat to his own happiness, than the eternal damnation of his loved ones
would be.

“assume that John dies an unrepentant mortal sinner and so goes into a state
of eternal suffering…So, on your view, God loves John and God allows John to
suffer eternally.”

Anyway, not a big deal. All that is required is clarification of the meaning
of the word “hell.”

(4) In a similar vein Rooney writes: “But, if God’s happiness essentially is
such that He cannot be happy without the happiness of the persons He creates,
God Himself essentially is such that His essence requires the existence of
those persons: i.e., God would not be God without me existing.” But this,
quite frankly, strikes me as just silly. The whole point of my analogy of the
young married couple choosing to have a child was that, for human beings,
having a child can change the conditions of their own happiness. Similarly,
God’s decision to create Rooney carries implications for how God will
providentially control his creation. One such implication is that God could
never both create Rooney and cause Rooney to experience excruciating and
debilitating pain throughout every moment of his earthly life plus every
moment of an everlasting existence in an afterlife. Yes, there is also an
important disanalogy here. For even though the parents of a child may
sometimes have no control over what may or may not happen to their child, God
has an absolute control over what he will permit happening to created persons;
and that is precisely why nothing that actually happens in creation could ever
threaten God’s own happiness.

The worries about ‘heresy’ are overblown. The term merely means doctrinal
error, saying something theologically false, or, as I put it, making nonsense
of the Gospel and the Christian story. And I think this is entirely true: if
hard universalism were true, the consequences (that God’s choices to cause us
to love Him simply could not have been otherwise or that human choices to love
God similarly count not have been otherwise) would undermine Christianity and
its story of salvation. Specifically, the Cross would be meaningless.

I have no doubt, by the way, that God could, if he chose to do so, wipe all
knowledge of such tragedies from our minds, although I doubt he could do so
effectively without destroying a lot more of our minds than we might imagine.
But blissful ignorance is a far cry from the most worthwhile forms of
happiness, and it has, in any case, no relevance at all to God’s own
happiness. So does God’s love for us likewise tie his interests together with
our own? If it does—and I see no way it could fail to do so—then God’s own
happiness surely is logically inconsistent with certain kinds of things
happening to us. Or, to put it another way, God’s own happiness could not
possibly be consistent with just anything we might imagine happening in his
creation. Nor does it follow that _actual events_ in the creation causally
determine God’s happiness or could otherwise threaten it. Accordingly, a bit
of clarity on this matter is essential to a proper evaluation of the following
objection that Rooney raises against Hart: “Now, strictly speaking, we _know_
it must be false in at least one instance that every person’s happiness
depends on every other. God’s happiness exists in communion with that of the
other Trinitarian persons; God’s happiness does _not_ depend on his
creatures.”

And for 2) that does some injury to the very teaching of what a “sacrament”
is. Water is taught as necessary for baptism, and baptism as necessary for the
remission of sins. Bread and wine and necessary for Eucharist, and the
Eucharist necessary for obedience to Christ’s mandate unto life eternal (Jn 6:
52-58) . There is necessarily a physical, material basis to “sacrament” as an
outward sign of an inward reality. The implication of your position (“some
ineffable ‘spiritual’ way and/or received them after death”) is that
sacraments are unnecessary.

What I can’t see (no matter how hard I try) is any approximation of the Good
in the intending and willing of one irrevocably confirmed in so absolute a
rejection of the Good that one’s willing and intending no longer manifest the
True, the Good, the Beautiful to *any* degree. One’s existence and experience
become pure ‘privation’ as such, like cancer cells that have consumed all the
healthy cells of their host and yet go on existing as cancer.

He is under the sway of a false belief, exactly what he accuses of the
denizens of hell. But his is not just any false belief, but the most
deplorable false belief that a person is capable of forming: he has mistaken
the God of love for a malevolent devil. His inability, at present, to
recognize his error is unfortunate, considering that he promulgates this
delusional, abusive belief.

In any event, with regards to clarity, of course, discernment is a matter of
prayer and thought — and thought at its highest level simply is prayer. I
think there are consequences to creatio ex nihilo, to the aseity of Divine
Plenitude, the implications to our understanding of Person that one can
properly recognize from a contemplation of Christology and the perichoresis of
Triune bliss. D. C. Schindler’s book The Catholicity of Reason offers a
helpful argument for understanding the “ecstatic” nature of rationality. In
short, even though we “see through a glass darkly” we are not bereft of the
capacity to make logical inferrence based upon revelation. None of this ought
to be considered out-of-bounds by any valid understanding of a magisterium.

In fact one doesn’t even need to hold that anyone is saved outside the
sacraments. The church does not descend into dust in the next world – it too
is resurrected – and for all we know it continues to administer the sacraments
to the dead as the visible means by which God gives them grace and finally
saves them.

Essential to the whole [redemptive] process, then, is that we exercise our
moral freedom—not that we choose rightly rather than wrongly, but that we
choose freely one way or the other. We can choose today to live selfishly or
unselfishly, faithfully or unfaithfully, obediently or disobediently. But our
choices, especially the bad ones, will also have unintended and unforeseen
consequences in our lives; as the proverb says, “The human mind plans the way,
but the Lord directs the steps” (Prov. 16:9). A man who commits robbery may
set off a chain of events that, contrary to his own intention, lands him in
jail; and a woman who enters into an adulterous affair may discover that, even
though her husband remains oblivious to it, the affair has a host of
unforeseen and destructive consequences in her life. In fact, our bad choices
almost never get us what we really want; that is part of what makes them bad
and also one reason why God is able to bring redemptive goods out of them.
When we make a mess of our lives and our misery becomes more and more
unbearable, the hell we thereby create for ourselves will in the end resolve
the very ambiguity and shatter the very illusions that made the bad choices
possible in the first place. That is how God works with us as created rational
agents. He permits us to choose freely in the ambiguous contexts in which we
first emerge as self-aware beings, and he then requires us to learn from
experience the hard lessons we sometimes need to learn. So in that way, the
consequences of our free choices, both the good ones and the bad ones, are a
source of revelation; they reveal sooner or later—in the next life, if not in
this one—both the horror of separation from God and the bliss of union with
him. And that is why the end is foreordained: all paths finally lead to the
same destination, the end of reconciliation, though some are longer, windier,
and a lot more painful than others.

For example, it is fallacious (a sort of appeal to future hope) to posit that,
if hell is eternal, it *must* be good for it to be so because God is wholly
good. For the sake of intellectual honesty, presuppositions must either be
sufficiently demonstrated or agreed upon by all parties involved. Furthermore,
unless this argument is about what is dogmatically permissible, signifiers
like “heresy” and “orthodoxy” do nothing to advance one’s argument without
having been sufficiently demonstrated, so I question why they continue to be
included in this debate.

(2) Rooney writes: “Talbott explicitly accepts the second fork of my dilemma:
arguing that failing to love God, i.e., to make ‘a free and fully informed
decision to reject God and his love’ – call this ‘a mortal sin’ – ‘represents
a metaphysical impossibility’ for human beings.” Of course, one could just as
easily claim that Rooney also accepts that second fork if he concedes that all
people fail to love God at some time during their earthly lives. For during
our earthly lives, we all emerge and begin making choices in a context of
ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception. Now Rooney rightly concedes the
following point: “People who go to heaven cannot – while in heaven – commit a
sin.” But he never addresses the question of whether the saints in heaven
continue to act freely even in a context where they are unable to do
otherwise. Instead, he suggests that “their choosing to love God, and so be in
a state where they cannot sin, is a product of those choices they made in
life”—choices made, in other words, at a time when they remain in a state of
relative ignorance and are therefore not yet fully informed. So if we take
this seriously, we must conclude that no one ever makes a fully informed
decision either to accept or to reject God. Because no one in this life is yet
in a position to make such a fully informed decision, moreover, neither is
anyone in this life in a position to commit a mortal sin in the sense defined
in the above quotation.

Steve, I take your point; but philosophers live by precision, and I think
Talbott was in his rights to point out that Rooney’s argument regarding who
goes to “hell” suffers from a fatal ambiguity, given that universalists often
speak of the wicked as going to hell (understood as temporary purification).
Rooney should have been more careful in the formulation of his argument.

To say God nevertheless derives from so irrevocable a state of evil some good
for others, or for creation at large, or even abstractly by virtue of being
that unfortunate possibility God must permit to get the good he desires, is
precisely the failure of the unconditional and infinite good, love, and beauty
which is, in the universalist’s view, the only Christianity worth speaking of.
If Rooney is right and Christianity is what he says it is, better it vanish
from the world as soon as may be.

“The kind of ignorance that undermines my culpability is only that ignorance
which violates NINF: ignorance such that my choice was such that I could not
have done anything to rectify that ignorance.”

“You’ve also been advised by some that the Person is ultimately a gift of
Christology and that relation is just as constitutive as “substance.” Hence,
it is incorrect to think the salvation of some and the damnation of others as
if one is dealing with atomized individuals.”

If there can be a good reason for permitting endless torment…well then, there
can be a good reason for any evil.

There might, however, be no space to open up if one is arguing against the
received orthodox apostolic understanding. Universalism might be
irreconcilable with the theology of the institutional apostolic Church(es).

This goes for Grunge music and, though it pains me to say, Kinkaid’s art. The
Good, the True, and the Beautiful are present, in some measure and
approximation, in all human artistic expression. If you try hard and sincerely
enough, you can see it in Grunge and Kinkaid.

It is certainly possible in this life for people to substitute the best –
choosing instead temporal pleasures – to pursue the allure of happiness only
to find a road that leads to despair. However, it is difficult to imagine that
– even in this life – a sane person would choose torment as a perpetual state
of existence. Now, consider if anyone would rationally embrace unimaginable
suffering vs. pleasure for an eternity.

As believers, we may trust that God will one day separate all people from
their sin (cf. Rom 11:25-32). And he can do this without violating the freedom
of man. For at the latest by death, all that he has wrongly idolized will be
knocked out of man’s hands.

Tom: I could be wrong, but it seems to me that if Rooney’s ‘unknown good’ is
to do the work of making ‘eternal conscious torment’ something God is
supremely good for permitting, that ‘unknown good’ has to be an
infinite/eternal good; in this case, an eternal conscious beatitude. I mean,
it has to make ‘eternal conscious torment’ mortally intelligible in its light.
It can’t be a transient, finite good, or a good which is not an ‘experienced
beatitude’. The only option I see is a ‘proportionate’ (equally
eternal/infinite experienced) beatitude. One has to argue the ‘possibility’
(Rooney’s ‘unknown good’ is this possibility) that humanity’s eternal
participation in divine beatitude could logically ‘require’ the proportionate
possibility of eternal experienced negation of this beatitude (i.e., Hell).
One would have to defend this particular ‘necessity’ (the necessity of
permitting such negation) as the metaphysical price-tag for creation’s eternal
participation in divine beatitude. And THAT, I’m fairly certain, is
impossible.

I don’t become apoplectic. I think it is wrong and makes the Christian story
of salvation nonsense if one believes that it is necessarily true that ‘all
will be saved.’ As part of that story, I deny quite explicitly and repeatedly
that God sends anyone to hell. God is the source of all goodness and we (free
creatures) are the source of moral evil. You are welcome to engage those
arguments and try to tell me where I made a mistake in showing that the
results of believing in either of the two forks of my dilemma are not
problematic for Christianity. I think our beliefs about God as the source of
all being and goodness would be nonsense if God literally cannot be happy
without creating or saving us, and that the Cross would be nonsense if human
beings were such that they could not do otherwise than love God.

No, it is not an ‘appeal to future hope’ that God does what is good. It is a
claim about God’s nature. If God is good, and we learn from Him that He allows
hell, we would immediately thereby know that there are eminently good reasons
for God to allow people to resist His grace forever. Similarly, when we
learned about the fact of animal suffering in evolutionary history, I think we
immediately can conclude that there are good reasons for God to allow this. In
other words, all I am pointing out is that problems of evil – whether moral or
natural – presume that a certain instance of evil cannot be given a justifying
reason and therefore that God does not exist (or is not loving, etc.).

Quite the contrary. If God is good, and we learn that someone said he allows
(really directly creates and sustains) hell, then we can know with absolute
certainty that that person does not speak for God. Because words like “good”
have meanings, and bearing on the character and actions of that which is
rightly called by them.

You are right Tom, I am sure that Fr. Rooney believes that God is good. Just
as I’m sure that he believes God is love. What I’m struggling with is his
definition of good and love.

I realise now that this was poorly phrased…  
Anyways, classical theists will still understand what I meant, of course.

It is noteworthy that you link the salvation of all with God’s goodness and
yet you remain staunchly unconvinced.

Allow me to throw in a quirk of thinking here: From Romans 5:18

Regarding your second paragraph: I was referring to this sentence from
Talbott’s article: “If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved,
something makes it so. The only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to
hell is.”

> I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps,

Don’t discount that as a Roman Catholic, he is obliged to believe in the
monster God who creates, ex nihlo and with foreknowledge, sentient creatures
who He knows will fall and thus condemn themselves of their own “free-will” to
an eternity of suffering. What must be in the back of his mind when defending
this Zeus-like Being is the threat that if he dares to go against the absolute
truths of Roman Catholic dogma, he himself will be cast headlong into the
fires.

So for your 1), Christ himself is said to have “descended into Hell” (or
Hades) to free the souls of the Just who died under the Old Law (alluded to in
Eph 4:9 and 1 Pet 3:18-19 and 4:6, and an occasional theme in Eastern
patristic and early apocryphal literature). They are saved by Christ (as we
all hope to be) as the first act of the New Law in fulfillment of the Old Law.
This does not however immediately solve the problem of universalism to
conclude that all people (including the unbaptized, along with the demons and
Lucifer) will be saved under the New Law.

Fr Rooney: “I am only arguing that it is impossible to show that it could not
be possible God might have a good reason to allow people to resist His love
forever.”

**2*** No one who experiences the bliss of union with the divine nature can
“do otherwise than love God,” and no one who freely refuses the offer of such
a union and then experiences the full horror of being separated from the
divine nature as far as this is possible short of one’s own annihilation can
continue to embrace that separation freely.

“The main claim of yours I deny, however, is that God puts Himself in contact
with us such that it would be impossible for us to have done otherwise than
love Him. God allows us to reject His love.”

It seems to me that the concepts of God’s love and goodness are not
impenetrable. In fact, they might be quite simple.

No, I do not think God keeping His promises is an object of free choice; what
God freely chooses is to make a promise with Abraham.

I think he is making a contradictory pair of claims: a mortal sinner is in
Hell ‘freely’ (which he defines as being able to do otherwise) but can’t do
otherwise than remain. So, in the broad sense of ‘logical’, he is making a
logical claim.

I’ve just read Fr. Kimel’s latest follow up to this blog posting called
“Universal Salvation: Love Is Its Own Necessity.”

A response to brian above: “…folks here are not granting your necessary
condition [on freedom].”

Yes, you would obviously conclude that on the grounds that this malicious God
decided to force the curse of existence on someone to whom he knew it would
prove a unending source of agony. “Loving” is a word that has meaning.

Incidentally, I would love to see your response to Brad’s question above as
well as to the questions that I have raised here.

Yes, when one asserts that God transcends finite antinomies and therefore
freedom and necessity uniquely converge in God (or one may say God is beyond
such conceptual boundaries), it more or less forces one to “speak nonsense” as
I imagine the three favored apostles did in the penumbra of Taboric light. As
probably always, I tend to agree with your “intelligent emotions” Tom, i.e.,
your intuitive sense of what is properly at stake, as well as your tenacious
refusal to let a matter of importance disappear into abstraction. Analogously,
I favor Balthasar’s view that Divine Plenitude must not lack the delight and
discovery of Event. I don’t assent to the notion that adventure is for
creaturely being, while God’s perfection precludes the possibility because
such would entail some unrealized potency. Undoubtedly, there are those who
will see this as an illicit gnosticism and counter to the univocal meaning of
terms. Similarly, I do not think God is motivated by lack. There is no
necessity of Creation of that kind. Nonetheless, I agree with Philip Sherrard
that God “must” create — something like the way Mozart had to compose music,
though, of course, not exactly. It becomes more complicated when one tries to
construe how divine Creation happens. Are the logoi of creatures divine ideas?
Does every logoi have an angelic being co-relative to earthly creatures.
(Bulgakov speculates something along these lines in Jacob’s Ladder.) Are
Platonic Essences too abstract? (Edith Stein tries to wed Aquinas and
phenomenology in ways that emphasize the uniquely personal.) Should one,
rather, think the logoi as derivative of the Logos and thus never distinct
from a ground in Incarnation? (This is Jordan Daniel Wood’s thesis in The
Whole Mystery of Christ.) I think the Christological is key, for it locates
the creative elan within the Trinitarian perfection. Balthasar has some great
things to say about the kenosis of the Spirit in our present age — and how the
artistry of the Spirit brings about the surprise of eternal beauty from the
rubble of earthly lives seemingly lost to dust and ashes.

2\. I’ve already presented my reasoning why the arguments that nobody is truly
culpable are unsound, so I simply do not concede that the context of the
present life renders it impossible to commit a mortal sin. There are lots of
people, for all I know, who do not love God and are living in mortal sin at
the present.

Fr Rooney: “If we did have to know all of God’s reasons for permitting every
instance of evil in order to be confident He was Good, we would be up sh*t
creek, I’d think.”

One must always take an interlocutor on his own terms, and then seek to
redefine toward common understanding.

First, what I said is that hell is not the worst state of a person absolutely
and, even within the world we live in where God permits mortal sin, what God
does is do what is best for that person despite their rejection of His love.
So, I rejected that we need to think God needs to do what is best for each
individual absolutely – as there is no uniquely ‘best state’ for any
individual, just as there is no uniquely ‘best’ world God could create. I take
it instead that the fact God could have created a world where God predestines
all does not show us that God does not do what is best for each person within
the world we actually inhabit – the world where God permits mortal sin and
resistance to His love. God could absolutely have predestined each person,
but, given His conditional limitation to create a world where He does not do
so (where grace can be resisted and He did not confirm all persons in grace
from the first moment of their existence), God possibly allows some persons to
resist His grace forever. Within these limits, God still would be doing what
is best even for the damned, insofar as it is within His power to do what is
best for them despite their everlasting resistance to His love.

This is not possible, unless you believe God to be something other than the
Good as such. The very nature of what it is to want dictates what you can and
cannot want.

3) If you infallibly knew that your family were due to die today and only
oblivion would await them after death, but if you wished you could choose to
make them life forever – but you also knew that their home from then on would
be inside a brutal medieval torture chamber – what would you do? Which do you
think would be the more loving choice? (as a bonus question, you can consider
the same scenario but imagine that they only get tortured if they had failed
to repent of a single mortal sin beforehand).

“ Nobody chooses eternal suffering for its own sake, including people in hell.
They choose what they believe will make them happy – even though it, in fact,
will bring them eternal suffering because what they love is incompatible with
love of God. … But there is no reason that they cannot continue to love that
thing which brings them pain indefinitely, precisely because they love it.”

Perhaps I can do no better, by way of a conclusion, than to reproduce a
paragraph from a section entitled “The Essential Role of Human Freedom in
Universal Reconciliation” from my book [_The Inescapable Love of
God_](https://www.amazon.com/Inescapable-Love-God-
Second/dp/1625646909?&linkCode=ll1&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId578bc044b4b725971afd80ff62ddd4b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
(pp. 123-124):

Thus, second, my claim was not that sin does not constitute a tragedy, which
would be absurd. My claim was specifically that God’s permitting the damnation
of some does not constitute an *irredeemable* tragedy. This is to say that God
allows sin and damnation because He can redeem it. That redemption, however,
-on the orthodox Christian story- does not require universal salvation.

1\. This bad thing that happened to me or my loved ones seems as if it is
pointless and meaningless.  
2\. But, I know God is good and is perfectly in control of the universe and
wishes nobody any harm.  
3\. So, I know that whatever happens – even bad things – are only allowed by
God because He has eminently good reasons for allowing them.  
4\. Therefore, I know that this bad thing that happened to me or my loved ones
is neither pointless, nor meaningless, but something allowed by God for my or
my loved ones’ good.

What’s more, what if God, in some alternate universe, freely created billions
of creatures directly into a state of eternal torment? With your God, nothing
actually precludes this possibility. God has unrestricted “freedom” and
everything that God does is, by definition, good.

In keeping with my intention to proceed more slowly, taking one baby step at a
time, I’ll await your response to this question before proceeding any farther
at this point, such as addressing the issue of importance.

My perspective on this is that all the ways God in Christ makes way for
grace/salvation are for our sake, not for God. The Church, sacraments, etc.,
enlarge the opportunity for humans to step into and participate in the Kingdom
of God even now – to begin to live the life of grace and redemption now – to
act explicitly as the Body of Christ now. But they do not restrict God from
acting salvifically outside of these avenues.

My guess is Fr Rooney will say he takes God’s goodness as a given as well.
What he’s disputing is not God’s goodness, but whether the Good God can have
no ‘good reason’ for permitting creatures to freely condemn themselves to an
eternal hell.

THOMAS AQUINAS  
In order that the happiness of the saints may be more delightful to them and
that they may render more copious thanks to God for it, they are allowed to
see perfectly the sufferings of the damned. So that they may be urged the more
to praise God. The saints in heaven know distinctly all that happens to the
damned. [Summa Theologica, Third Part, Supplement, Question XCIV, “Of the
Relations of the Saints Towards the Damned,” First Article, “Whether the
Blessed in Heaven Will See the Sufferings of the Damned?”]

This is a bad argument. Here’s a simple reason to reject it: if God’s relation
to the universe is just as constitutive of what He is as His substance, then
God could not exist without the universe and the people in it. This is
immediately and obviously nonsense about the divine nature (since God is not
dependent on anything, by definition as the First Cause of all being,
existence, and goodness).

Forgive me for the offense. It was not intended as such, but meant simply as a
statement of the deep difference between how the West and the East view God
and His relationship to His creatures. This is why Apokatastasis was
predominantly taught in the East, while the one theological school in the
Early Church that taught ECT was in the Roman West.

This is what I don’t get about the universalist claim — let’s say it is true:
then the past 2000 years appear to have been a rather grave institutional
error. Are you ready to admit to that consequence? Or how would you save the
apostolic faith and the authority of the apostolic Church without a complete
reset?

Hi Stephen. We haven’t spoken before but I hope you are well.  
——

Unfortunately, all of the imprecisions, as I view them, in Rooney’s original
article seem to remain in his latest response to me. Here are a few examples:

Fr. Aidan, undoubtedly then, I was thinking of someone else’s argument. I’m
not trying to put words in your mouth.

“I think it is perfectly legitimate to hope in God’s goodness that He might
save all.”

One can obviously be a baptized Christian and care nothing for the things of
God or *charity* as understood in the light of the Gospel, living a completely
selfish, self absorbed life, using people for carnal gratification and self
aggrandizement, exploiting others, being fully culpable in freedom while being
uncaring of one’s moral obligations to one’s Maker and neighbor. This is a
condition of mortal sin, which scripture tells us requires the remediation of
the Church through the sacraments for the forgiveness of sins and the
restoration of the soul. That forgiveness is dispensed in the language of
grace that restores the soul to relationship with God.

To be honest, Steven, the best summary of my universalist convictions is my
book [_Destined for Joy_](https://amzn.to/3tXO9H0).

“The worst possible state of a person is non-existence, not hell . . . [T]he
possibility that some be damned is not an irredeemable tragedy from God’s
point of view. Why? Because He will still continue to do what is best for
those persons in hell. Thus, hell is not the worst state of a person, since it
is a place where God’s love is present and God is doing what is best for
someone, insofar as it is in God’s power to do so, given what He wills for the
universe and the rest of humanity.”

It would help if folks clarified carefully which sense of free will they had
in mind. For example, it’s possible to be free in a libertarian sense
regarding amoral choices but not free in this sense regarding moral choices.
This confusion attaches to the criticism that if one supposes God is free to
do other than ‘create’ he must be free to do other than ‘speak the truth’ or
‘love’ or ‘act justly’. But this equivocates on the sense of ‘freedom’ meant.
God (ex hypothesi) may be free with respect to ‘creating or not’ (creating is
not a ‘moral’ choice as such) but not free free in this same sense with
respect to moral acts such as love, justice, truth, mercy, etc.

“God is free in terms of not being necessitated in choice among the
alternatives open to Him”

What if no one was saved? What if the plan of salvation is actually a total
failure and God knew that it would be a total failure?

This is why the moral imagination, or moral sense, is always on the table.
There is no establishing Rooney’s “unknown good” on purely logical grounds. If
it’s supposed to justify God’s goodness in bringing such a world unnecessarily
to be, then it’s a moral claim, not a merely logical one, and it’s resolved
within the scope and exercise of our moral imagination and sense. This is why
it doesn’t matter that Rooney cannot be explicit about his “unknown good.” It
fails on account of the moral character of the final end in light of which it
must be measured.

Posted on [20 November 2022](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-
dominic-rooneys-critique-of-universalism/ "10:07 am") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr

If you answer that it is not possible for John to change his mind, then (by
your own definition of freedom) his remaining in hell is not the result of his
free choice. Thus, you would have to part company with Lewis’s ‘locked from
the inside’ view and take Hell to be an externally imposed punishment.

I would only say that evil and suffering that is temporary is an entirely
different species from that which is endless. That should go without saying. I
don’t think one can argue that the potential justification for the former
leads necessarily to the justification for the latter.

What is God? The way I see it, your usage of that name is hollow, if it isn´t
to be identified with the Good. Unfortunately you have already conceded in
past comment sections that our desire for the Good must be distinguished from
love of God, but now the object of that love is unknowable. It can´t be the
figure of Jesus, after all if we´re philosophizing about what God is, Jesus
never enters the picture up until the point of revelation, where philosophy
has long ended. It would exclude all the other abrahamic religions, but to no
fault of their own, of course. There are very rational reasons against
Christianity and Catholicism, so we can´t blame anyone for not accepting
either, let alone with eternal punishment.

Joe: If there can be a good reason for permitting endless torment…well then,
there can be a good reason for any evil.

If you’re interested in exploring this topic, I suggest you look through my
[Recommended Reading List](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/essential-readings-
on-universalism/). I recommended especially Tom Talbott’s _The Inescapable
Love of God_ and Kronen and Reitan’s _God’s Final Victory_.

It’s not only the uncomfortable truth for Catholics but for ALL classical
theists in the usual sense …

“Presumably, Rooney thinks that, e.g., God keeping his promises to Abraham is
‘outside’ of His own life and hence an object of His free choice.”

But what is left of any of that if there is no such need to bring people to
eternal life from the death of sin? Why would anyone celebrate the Holy
Mysteries unless they bring us grace, and that grace was actually conducive to
our sanctification and salvation? What does *metanioa* (or even *sin*) mean if
there is no such thing as sanctifying grace to restore us to relationship to
God?

What kind of mother would she be if Our Lady allowed to stand static a
situation where she has more grace than her children?

2) they received the sacraments in some ineffable ‘spiritual’ way and/or
received them after death – in which case universalists can hold this is what
happens to everyone.

This is patently absurd. No one would choose eternal suffering over
annihilation. The former is obviously worse, so the notion that, by permitting
their eternal suffering, God is doing what’s best for them ‘given the
circumstances’ is sheer nonsense.

“No, I do not think God keeping His promises is an object of free choice; what
God freely chooses is to make a promise with Abraham.”

You are a better person than I am, and obviously have more patience than I do.
I commend you on your equable tone, whose only moments of severity have to do
with clarifying obscurities. I have given into emotional fatigue in this
debate. That admitted, I have to say that Rooney’s arguments are obviously so
confused on so many issues–not least in trying to harmonize his brand of
libertarianism with Thomas’s rigorous intellectualism on most matters–that one
has to assume he is motivated not by reason, but by what he regards as
fidelity to true doctrine. At least, I assume he would not make such odd and
circular arguments if he were not convinced he must, and that therefore he
must be right.

I am wondering where you find this in Fr. Rooney’s writings, and in the
Catholic Church’s teaching on mortal sin.

If anyone believes that God has “foreknowledge” of everything, which is
necessarily the case if He is omniscient and if He eternally exists in the
*present*, meaning that there isn’t even a *future* for Him so we can’t even
speak of “foreknowledge” in His case (and this is what most Christians are
supposed to believe, including most Catholics), and that God also *knew* He
was creating the pre-conditions that can lead souls to Hell (whether it is
temporary or eternal) when He precisely decided to create them, something that
He *obviously* would’ve known, being again omniscient… Then, that “anyone”
must also believe that God just *knew* all along that SOME souls would indeed
go to Hell, and even WHO would actually go there…  
…And yet, He created these people anyways, knowing all along what their fate
would be beyond this life.

I distinguish: if God chooses to create John, that is an act of love, and God
cannot simultaneously fail to will to create John at the same time He does so
will, on pain of logical contradiction. But God is not thereby committed to
will any and all goods for John.

I’m going to give myself high blood pressure if I keep this up. It’s like
debating the merits of getting your brain sucked out for Lord Azathoth – the
mere idea that anyone could put forth the affirmative shows something
profoundly inhuman about them. I’m out.

I hope those are helpful questions to ponder on – I imagine your responses
would help us better understand the roots of your position.

Fr. Rooney suggests that in an eternal hell…  
“(God) remains with and beside (people) even in the midst of their despair.
This is the way in which God does what is best for them even when they turn
against His love.”

As to the claim about ‘libertarian’ free choice, my arguments have nothing to
do with it and ‘could’ has no bearing on the matter thus far. I proposed
claims about culpability that match exactly what you are saying here. If my
state were such that I could not (simply) have done otherwise than believe X,
and I do Y on the basis of my belief X, then my action Y could not have been
otherwise. Imagining that Y is a bad action (say, believing in universalism,
despite universalism being false), I would not be morally culpable for failing
to believe the truth – i.e., I would be invincibly ignorant that Christian
orthodoxy concerning the everlasting nature of hell is the truth. As I noted,
this view of culpability does not contradict, but is a consequence of, NINF.

Regarding (2), while most Orthodox priests believe that it is the *real*
Origen that was condemned during the Fifth Ecumenical Council (mostly because
they’ve been taught so, because this is the official narrative of what
supposedly happened even though it might very well be a false one), most of
them still consider him to have been a Church Father – and a particularly
important one to boot.  
While Marcellus of Ancyra and Theodore of Mopsuestia were condemned (for
different reasons, see the Three Chapters Controversy regarding Theodore), it
is also my understanding that both (or at least Theodore) are *nevertheless*
regarded as Church Fathers by most scholars and clergymen.  
Thus, I would say that the Church might indeed deem a person worthy of the
title of Church Father or Church Mother even though it has previously
condemned him/her as a heretic, though it would only do so reluctantly and not
without any dissent among its own devout and clergymen.  
A Church Father or Mother might very well be extremely influential upon many
generations of later Christian teachers as well as impeccably proto-orthodox
for a long time (even for their whole life), but then fall *post-mortem* into
heterodoxy (at least allegedly) because Christian teachings have evolved a lot
since their passing, and… And then they might get *condemned* for having
failed to be *perfectly* in line with an orthodoxy that didn’t even exist
while they were still alive (makes perfect sense, I know).  
It is therefore my understanding that a Christian teacher really becomes a
Church Father or Mother *mostly* insofar as they have exerted a great
influence on the development of Christianity, their *potential* condemnation
(whether real or imagined) not withstanding.  
As far as I can tell, this also answers (1), actually : as long as a Christian
teacher exerts quite a lot of influence on the theology of at least several
important contemporaries that will *later* be considered to have been orthodox
(and/or on the theology of *later* important teachers of the Church), or as
long as an early Christian has significantly influenced/shaped the course of
Christianity in a way that is thought to have been mostly positive by *most*
later “orthodox” theologians… This seems to me to be enough to make that
teacher a Church Father or a Church Mother, their potential disagreements with
fellow great teachers of the Church (who would also have to be Church Fathers
and Mothers, by definition), no matter *what* they are… Not truly
withstanding.

In any case, here is a revision of Rooney’s second option, the truth of which
I am prepared to defend:

Similar remarks apply to the view of Lewis, with which Rooney concurs, that
“the doors of hell are locked on the inside.” Given the traditional view of
hell as an externally imposed punishment for sin, one that includes
everlasting conscious torment, we can at least make coherent sense of why no
one would ever exit from a hell of that kind; it would simply not be
permitted. But Lewis imagines hell to be a freely embraced condition rather
than an externally imposed punishment; that is the whole point of declaring
that “the doors of hell are locked on the inside.” And that also raises again
the obvious question of how someone who is rational enough to qualify as a
free moral agent could both experience the sheer horror of separation from the
divine nature (or the misery of hell, if you prefer) and continue freely to
embrace it forever.

David Bentley Hart said it best…  
“To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it.”

Might I ask why you find the idea of Apokatastasis to be impossible? Is it
because your Church teaches it as dogma, or are there other reasons which you
find compelling?

Indeed, why should we accept an inchoate and imperfect concept of person as
articulating what can only be revealed in the light of Christ’s action? The
humanity of Christ is not an aggregate of individuals, some saved and some
unfortunately lost to perpetual resistance. As Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy
intimated, all the names are theophoric. Personhood is always Christological,
and so willing is never separated from the perfection of Jesus’ high priestly
prayer. The I Am is also always a We Are. Even on the plane of historical
causation, no one speaks a sentence that is not indebted to an immemorial
past. I do not think apart from the bond of language and thoughts of those who
came before me. I do not choose merely as an “individual,” but as a person who
is inescapably entangled in the thoughts and decisions of the innumerable who
are prior to my historical moment, just as my actions contribute to those who
come after me. I certainly find particular sinners odious. There are crimes of
unimaginable wickedness that rightly call forth the furies. Nonetheless, the
pleroma of perfected humanity alone shall reveal the glory of persons. Christ
is the Adam that knows the eternal Names. The separation of wheat and tares,
the sheep and the goats, all that is intrapersonal, a winnowing of the poison
of wicked idols that strut upon the stage of history with names ignorant of
the truth of what we shall be and who we truly are.

Then it really doesn’t matter. I was not aiming to give sufficient, but only
one necessary condition on freedom. It affects my argument not in the least
that there might be other conditions, because I showed that universalism
requires violating that necessary condition. If that were true, then your own
condition is irrelevant, since you admit that mine is a necessary condition –
that is, if my arguments that universalism entails you simply cannot do
otherwise are correct, then universalism entails that agents lack the freedom
you outline too.

Ah, the famous “consensus” of the Fathers… That which explains why the Fathers
could not agree on whether everyone will be saved or not, could not agree on
the Original Sin VS Ancestral Sin debate, could not agree on Augustinian
Predestination, could not agree on whether Hell is an actual place or a state
of the soul, could not agree on…  
Yes, yes, that famous “consensus”, indeed, we remember now…

My alternative is not to delight in death and suffering, but to think that
what we need is hope in God’s goodness, rather than a further weak and unsound
attempts to argue (as ‘hard universalists’ do) that hell is somehow
metaphysically impossible.

As I’ve repeatedly argued, the burden of proof is the other way around: my
argument is simply that there is no good reason why God cannot permit people
to persist in sin forever. I do not need to outline or imagine any reason God
had for permitting it, let alone an ‘aesthetic’ one (which I reject).

Fr. Rooney’s God isn’t so much a moral monster, but rather an impotent deity
whose intentions are forever thwarted by mere mortals.

“I am arguing that we have no reason to believe that a world in which God has
chosen to permit people to resist His love forever and so permit hell – what I
take to be the actual world – is not among those worlds in which God is not
doing what is best for those in the world.”

You’re making a fallacy of equivocation. “Hell” in classical orthodox theology
is eternal. It is permanent state of separation from God, what else it’s
nature might be. It is unjust to redefine Fr Rooney’s plain and obvious term,
claim hell might be something else, and then accuse him of a non sequitur.

I actually don’t quite hold this. My argument is simply that universalists
have not shown that it is impossible for God to permit people to reject His
love forever – and that proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no
way to do so.

So, to answer your question : yes, things do work in the same way also for
Catholics, it’s just that the Orthodox usually recognise *many more* Fathers
and Mothers than the Catholics.

Let us, again for the sake of argument, assume that John dies an unrepentant
mortal sinner and so goes into a state of eternal suffering.

But enough of that. After several long-winded responses back and forth,
further responses of that kind tend to be more and more unfruitful. So at this
point I prefer to slow down and focus on a single issue, taking one tiny baby
step at a time. I had thought that the question of whether God freely keeps
his promises would be a good starting point. But Rooney answered this question
when he wrote: “No, I do not think God keeping His promises is an object of
free choice; what God freely chooses is to make a promise with Abraham.”
That’s because God’s breaking a promise would be a logical impossibility. So
here is the first question I would put to Rooney—not for the purpose of
controversy, but merely for the sake of clarity. Given your own conception of
divine freedom, would you say that the God who cannot lie never tells the
truth freely?—and that he never freely acts in a just way?—and that he never
freely acts in a loving way toward his creatures? I presume you would agree
that these are very important matters. Would you therefore agree that many of
God’s most important actions, as you understand them, do not qualify as
genuinely free actions?

Thanks for your response. Because I am leaving town for the rest of the week,
this quick response of mine will probably be the last post of mine this week.
But I would like to acknowledge point 4 of your post above and raise one
additional question. Because we should all be free to define the technical
terms we are using in any way we see fit, I am quite willing to accept your
understanding of divine freedom. Still, I cannot resist the temptation to
point out that your claim that my questions are ambiguous rests upon the same
points I made when I first raised those questions. Also I don’t see why these
points make the questions ambiguous in any case.

“If God is good, and we learn from Him that He allows hell, we would
immediately thereby know that there are eminently good reasons for God to
allow people to resist His grace forever.”

“How vast a spectacle then bursts upon the eye! What there excites my
admiration? what my derision? Which sight gives me joy? which rouses me to
exultation? — as I see so many illustrious monarchs, whose reception into the
heavens was publicly announced, groaning now in the lowest darkness with great
Jove himself, and those, too, who bore witness of their exultation; governors
of provinces, too, who persecuted the Christian name, in fires more fierce
than those with which in the days of their pride they raged against the
followers of Christ.”

Why this, then, if universalism is true? How can one “eat and drink
condemnation (κριμα) unto oneself” by receiving the Lord unworthily (αναχιοσ)?
In the Eastern and Western apostolic traditions we are always unworthy except
for the sanctifying graces of the sacraments. Yet we seek to cooperate with
those graces by preparing ourselves through prayer, metanioa and confession,
spiritual disciplines, fasting, care for the sacred things, and such.

You are welcome, dKow, to say where you find my response to these points
objectionable. I reject that the fact we are made for God makes it that
impossible for us to do anything other than love God. Pineapples are made for
growing more pineapples, but they sometimes fail to do it, and do not thereby
cease to be pineapples. They just count as defective pineapple plants. So too
a person who fails to love God and ends up in everlasting separation from Him
falls short of the mark, being a defective human being, but is not thereby any
less a rational or responsible person.

If non-existence is the greatest evil for every substance, the logical
conclusion is that God creates everything he possibly could, no?

I would state it in this way: It is impossible to show what makes eternal
torment possible as a good and reasonable outcome, particularly when the
salvation of all is both better and possible.

So, if this helps, the problem for me is not that there is any disharmony
between what you suggest about the Lord’s Supper and orthodox Catholic
sacramental theology. It is more that what is omitted is important: without
the notion that the Eucharist is *also* the continued offering of the Lord
under the sacrament signs, and which sacrifice provides sanctifying grace
conducive to our sanctification and salvation; that it is not just food for
the journey, or a moment of spiritual intimacy with the Lord, but actually a
*sacerdotal act* of the Lord as the High Priest for the forgiveness of sins,
then the Liturgy is impoverished.

You know, no matter how often Thomists repeat this ridiculous and horrifying
claim, I can’t make myself believe that they can make themselves believe it.
An eternity of suffering is better than nonexistence?

According to Rooney’s first option, as he originally formulated it, “God could
not do other­wise than cause human beings to love him.” As [Jeremiah
Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-salvation-a-
response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) points out in a previous response to
Rooney on this blog, the term “cause” is simply too vague in the present
context and clearly needs further clarification. But I shall concentrate here
on the expression “could not do otherwise” and the role it plays in Rooney’s
understanding of divine freedom. “What is necessary” for divine freedom,
Rooney insists, “is that God could have done otherwise”—in other words, that
“God is free of necessity in what he chooses to do.” Rooney thus contends that
“what it is to be free (for both God and humans) is that one’s actions are not
necessary” in that one acts freely only when one could have acted otherwise.

“He remains with and beside them even in the midst of their despair. This is
the way in which God does what is best for them even when they turn against
His love.”

This idea, and many other odd views of God, is not limited to Roman Catholics.
I read articles by Orthodox laity and priests who, when I read them, appear to
have blood squirting out of their eyes as they write. I find myself wondering
at Pascha, when we sing with gusto “Christ is risen from the dead, BY DEATH HE
CONQUERED DEATH. . .” if they really believe it or have even thought of the
conflict between that lovely hymn and their intense death grip on the doctrine
of eternal conscious torment?

If you do not think it is a necessary condition for freedom that you have the
ability to have done otherwise, simply and absolutely, then causal determinism
could be true – all of our actions determined by the course of the cosmos, the
initial physical conditions and laws, with only one possible unique physical
future – and we would still be able to be free. This looks even worse than
saying I can still be free when someone pushes me down the stairs and I could
have done nothing at all to prevent it.

Which sight gives me joy? Really? Is the the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the
One who said “Father, forgive them . . . after they had just driven nails into
His hands and feet? I think not!

Would you at least admit that, if this is true, that God is not an absolute
victor over evil? I mean, that much is abundantly obvious! Unless, of course,
you want to redefine “victorious” in the same manner as “goodness”.

But thankfully, error can always be dispelled, and he cannot become locked in
a false belief forever. And God will forgive him for spreading the most
atrocious lies about Him.

I challenge you to support your grotesque caricature with even one source that
is identifiably Catholic.

The assertion that God has or needs reasons for his acting seems to me to be
completely inappropriate and anthropomorphic. God is not dependent on
anything, not even on any reasons. In view of God’s absoluteness and
incomprehensibility it is impossible to speculate about God’s reasons and to
take the point of view of God.

I’m in agreement with you. Just wanted to add a comment. It seems to me that
even if such categories can comprehend created agency (I’m a libertarian [not
voluntarist] re: some choice, as you know), there’s no way these terms map
God’s eternal/immutable self-determination regarding creation. This has been
the whole point regarding the attempt to construe God’s freedom vis-a-vis
creating as an instance of that deliberation implying a counterfactual (or as
an instance of any of the competing accounts of deliberative choice known to
us) that defines choice for us. But even if one wanted to approach ‘as
libertarian as possible’ a view of God’s freedom vis-a-vis creation, one would
still have to qualify away elements essential to such choice, and whatever
sort of ‘power to the contrary’ or counterfactual truth regarding God’s
determination one ended up with after making the necessary qualifications, it
would be so off the map as to be unrecognizably ‘libertarian’ (or
‘compatibilist’ or ‘deterministic’) were it applied to created choices. My
point is, so much of Fr Rooney’s comebacks (as in his above response to you)
make this very mistake, i.e., fail to take into account the transcendent
difference between divine choice (its nature, freedom, necessity, etc) and
creaturely choice. God’s choice to create is not an instance of any concept or
understanding of choice we have at our disposal. It’s likely that all succeed
(and fail) at different points and in different respects at approximating the
truth to some extent.

Before ya’ll wind down I thought I’d toss in a few thoughts regarding various
usages attached to the group of terms ‘free’, ‘freedom’, ‘free will’, even
‘liberty’, etc.

In other words, universal salvation is a reality, according to Romans, but
those who have refused it here on earth, declining to set out on the journey
of prayer, fasting, alms giving, and the Sacraments, shall find that their
deeds condemn them in the presence of God. So, the question then becomes, is
repentance possible for them after death? Is it possible that after they have
seen the Good, seen their own evil for what it is, they shall truly be
repentant and turn to God, accepting whatever recompense He demands for their
evil deeds? As one who holds to the Universalist hope, I think this is
possible and just. No wicked man (or woman) shall escape the promise of both
Christ and St. Paul that we shall be rewarded in kind for our deeds here on
earth. But the idea of a never-ending punishment not only accomplishes
nothing, it flies in the face of the very justice which God Himself told us to
have – lex talionis – the punishment fits the offense. This, and a number of
other reasons I have pondered upon, are reasons why I find eternal punishment
to be unreasonable, illogical, and unworthy of the One who is Love.

>”universalist arguments deny that “mortal sin” as defined by the Catholic
church is possible (i.e. deliberate sin despite full understanding) and Fr
Rooney “refutes” this by saying “mortal sin” is possible because a degree of
culpability is still possible even without full understanding, thus
heterodoxically redefining “mortal sin” as any degree of culpability at all,
and pretending he has countered the argument that “mortal sin” by the *normal
Catholic definition* is impossible.”

I’m already back in my cave. Chinese food, a glass of Pinot Noir, and Star
Trek Voyager cued up for the evening.

When Western Christians see the word “judgment” in the Scriptures, they
immediately see God as the Fearsome Judge and Mighty Smiter (tip of the hat to
Brad Jersak for that term) who is sitting in judgment to PUNISH. But judgment
could have an entirely different meaning, you know. A doctor, when looking at
a very ill patient, has to make a judgment. He judges the condition and the
patient in order to come up with the proper cure. Why could not judgment be to
the healing of the soul instead of to condemnation.

I think everyone would agree ‘freedom’ in its highest, perfected form is the
unrestricted expression of a nature’s God-given powers. No deliberation with
respect to the good is even possible. DBH makes this point often and
successfully.

Kenanada: You [Fr Rooney] are essentially challenging universalists to prove
that God is truly Good. And I suppose this really is a matter of faith and …
in the end God will reveal to all who He truly is. … I think this debate is
really about God’s character.

Reading through your comments, you consistently distill your line of reasoning
as the following…

Fr. Rooney would have us believe that…  
“the suffering in hell is caused by the damned perceiving God’s love for
them.”

First, thank- you to Thomas Talbott for his many contributions over many years
to our collective understanding of the love of God. For many of us, he has
been the forerunner in the resurgence of evangelical universalism in our
lifetimes.

Fr. Rooney appears to prize coherency, but it is evident he has given an
idiosyncratic meaning to the term. What he really values is agreement with his
understanding of Catholic orthodoxy and the consensus of the tradition. He
declares that the meaning of the gospel cannot be determined purely by an
accumulation of proof texts, but rather by a holistic understanding that could
then properly adjudicate the relative meaning of disparate texts. (Well, he
doesn’t say this, but were he capable of a just expression of what he says he
intends, it would come to something like that.) However, that mode of
interpretation is exactly what universalists employ. And if competing
interpretations both lay claim to such a hermeneutic, how is one to
adjudicate? As I have often written before, there are metaphysical
consequences to creatio ex nihilo, to the plenitude of Triune aseity, to
Personhood in light of Trinity and Incarnation. For instance, does a
soteriology that treats persons as nominalist individuals or Divine favor as
voluntarist freedom match up with the best metaphysical understanding derived
from what is implicit in the gospel? That is where genuine coherence is to be
discovered or found lacking.

Your question (again, “I wonder if things work in the same way also for
Catholics”) also seems to me to imply that you do not know yet that there’s an
important difference between “orthodox” (small o) and “Orthodox” (capital O).  
Basically, someone is (small o) orthodox if his beliefs are considered to be
mainstream, normal, accepted by *most*.  
In this case, he professes (small o) orthodoxy, an orthodoxy that can be
religious, political, scientific, historical, etc.  
Thus, you can call a socialist politician a (small o) “orthodox socialist” if
the socialism that he promotes is the one flavour of socialism that *most* of
his fellow socialists believe in, while an “orthodox” biologist is (among
other things) convinced that Evolution is an indubitable scientific fact for
which there is overwhelming evidence (like the vast majority of his
colleagues).  
In the sphere of religion, though, things become a bit trickier : there’s
*both* “orthodoxy” and “Orthodoxy”, with the latter term referring either to a
specific Christian Church (or rather Churches, since there’s the *Oriental*
Orthodox Church and the *Eastern* Orthodox Church), or to a specific brand of
Judaism (Orthodox Judaism).  
Hence, when I wrote about the “proto-orthodox” and the “orthodox” teachers of
the Church, I actually had in mind *all* the “mainstream” Christian teachers
(Church Fathers and Mothers in particular), not just those who are venerated
in the Orthodox Church.

Playing Rooney’s “logic” game, the universalist is apt to counter: “It is
impossible to show that it could not be possible God might have a good reason
for—and way of—saving all people.”

2) If you infallibly knew that only oblivion awaited us after death, would you
advise that hospices should shut down in order to be replaced by centres that
pursued the most aggressive and painful treatments for all, even if this
rendered them miserable for months merely to purchase a single extra hour of
unliveable life?

I’m glad that you concede that hell would be an instance of God permitting
evil. In fact, hell is the epitome of evil. The difference, once again, is
that this evil is eternal. This difference is everything.

“If one Father disagreed with the others, how could there be a consensus”.

Presumptuously rejecting an obviously held understanding, changing the
meaning, and then accusing him of a fallacy, is among the most discrediting
rhetorical tactics. It is completely out of bounds for any serious discussion,
let alone a criticism of an argument.

My apologies. Having not read to the bottom of the page, I just posted
something which may be construed as such an attack. As such, please remove it
if you find it beyond the pale of decent and polite disagreement.

“I do not need to give any reason for which God does allow hell in order for
it to be clear, logically, that if theological determinism were false, your
claim that God would be ‘actively and maliciously’ causing people to go to
hell in every world where He permitted hell would also be false.”

“God does not agree, as I see it, that it would be better to let anyone commit
suicide.”

My argument has conceded consistently that, yes, the state of souls in hell is
very bad, and that, yes, we should not rejoice in it, and that, yes, even God
does not rejoice in it. I am not arguing hell is desirable in itself. Rather,
I am arguing that the universalist has not consistently demonstrated that God
might not legitimately or justifiably permit people to be in this very bad
state, and that the arguments that God cannot permit this state often involve
controversial assumptions that involve misunderstanding what that bad state
consists in. That is why I am pointing out that God continues to do what is
best for the people in hell, as far as it within His power, in order to try to
make clear that God’s reasons for permitting hell are not merely reasons for
Him to do whatever He wants to human beings, but are good reasons even for the
damned. So too when I say that hell is not the worst state of a person, I am
attempting to highlight that hell is not positively willed by God, but rather
only tolerated.

Tom: “It would all depend on the ‘final end’ in light of which such evils and
suffering are judged. To conclude God is Good in spite of temporal evils, even
unspeakable temporal horrors encountered ‘en route’ – that’s one thing. There
is a “final end” in light of which all ‘en route’ evils are judged. But to
conclude God is Good in light ‘eternal’ torment? There is a profound
difference.”

1) If you were offered the choice between either suffering an eternity of pain
in hell – or alternatively, to pass into non-existence – which would you
choose? And could you please explain your reasoning?

And also the assertion that eternal damnation would not constitute a tragedy
from God’s point of view is not only absurd, it is also blatantly unbiblical.
“Have I any pleasure that the wicked should die?”

This posits a will which is random, or which has no telos. If a will has an
end then it is in fact necessary that certain information would change what it
wants. Or, rather, make it more consciously aware of what it always wanted.

Could it be that this salvific work is already finished for all mankind? In
keeping with the parable of the strong man, who is bound, and his house
plundered of its goods, Christ bound the strong man, the Evil One, destroyed
death by His death, and has redeemed and rescued all that ever have or shall
live. In Orthodoxy, we do not define hell as a place, but as being in the
presence of God but not wanting to, while at the same time, suffering for our
choices of sin.

“I am not unaware that union with God through grace is a great good, but even
this union comes in degrees. The Blessed Virgin shares far greater in the
grace of Christ than I or you possibly could. There is no uniquely greatest or
best degree of union with God, and so God does not ‘fail’ a person by not
elevating them to the degree of glory of the BVM, for example.”

In this case, obviously, evil is never blotted out but will persist without
end. Goodness and evil will co-exist forever.

So I don’t see any loss or failure of goodness in imagining God as ‘not-
creating’. What doesn’t exist has no claim upon God in this sense, as we’ve
already heard. But I also can’t image God deliberating his way through a menu
of libertarian options. Standard counterfactual logic is going to fail here.

People who are made happy by the suffering of others are called sadists.

Fr. Rooney is putatively engaged in debate with Christian universalists.
Talbott’s use of the subjunctive is the proper means for indicating one is
talking about a matter where one specifies a particular stance that is not
uniformly held. Naturally, the classic infernalist understanding of hell as
permanent separation from God precludes apokatastasis, but Fr. Rooney cannot
begin an argument by requiring everyone to agree with precisely what is in
question.

The entire “Great and kingly house”, the “Temple of the Holy Spirit”, the
“Heavenly City” seems to be just a house of cards that tumbles at the end of
the aion. I don’t see how you even save the appearances.

In trying to defend the possibility that some will choose an eternal hell Fr.
Rooney asserts that…

You’re arguing with someone incapable of moral reasoning, Calvin. It’s just
going to infuriate you. He actually thinks he’s making sense. He’s been so
thoroughly indoctrinated in nihilistic evil that the absurdity of the god he
believes in is wholly invisible. Pity him, but pity yourself also. To beat
your head against a seared conscience is self-torture.

“…the ambiguity of terms is exacerbated by a constant shifting between
creaturely freedom in its potency and it’s flourishing perfection, as well as
concomitant confusions regarding Divine agency.”

Fr Rooney: I am only arguing that it is impossible to show that it could not
be possible God might have a good reason to allow people to resist His love
forever.

And so, I believe that the universalist understanding is first the logical
exposition of a proper consideration of what the gospel reveals about God. I’m
sorry to repeat myself, but as “orthodox” defenders almost always simply skip
over this material, it is somewhat unavoidable. Certainly, the logic of the
Triune God defeats the certitudes and logic of finite being. Yet revelation
opens up to philosophy the capacity to think truths in the light of what is
revealed. There are consequences to creatio ex nihilo, to the plenitude of
Triune Being that excludes lack, etc. Because God exceeds finite thinking does
not imply that the Good might be what is evil in other cases. The best version
of universalist thought begins with reason and metaphysics and the
implications of revelation. When you advert to evils that occur in history as
if that is a plausible line of thought for eschatology, you make an illicit
move. No one denies that “God writes straight with crooked lines.” That
Providence works to heal the wounded, to defeat death, to destroy sin is not
in question. As a penultimate chapter in the working out of Creation, one
trusts amidst perplexity. It is a dark knowledge that exceeds the human
capacity to discern as you correctly understand. However, that does not mean
that such indeterminacy extends to the eschaton. One may not know the complex
and mysterious path to ultimacy and still rightfully recognize that one view
of the Perfected universe is more alligned with the gospel than another.

I’ll say this one last time. You’re arguing with a willfully seared
conscience. This poor fellow has made himself believe his position is coherent
and made himself believe that he really doesn’t know the position he rejects
is obviously true. You can repeat these clear and simple truths to him ten-
billion times, and he will continue to make the same confused and deeply evil
arguments.

So this claim has been responded to. Would you like to respond to my response?
Because you don’t get to just restate your position when it has been shown to
be wrong. What is the counter-argument? And what is your response both to the
defense I offer for patristic universalism, and the counter-attack I also go
on to offer? Because that’s where the conversation sits, and you don’t just
get to reassert your (flawed) thesis and call it a day.

Though Rooney claims that a libertarian understanding of freedom is not
required for his view, without such an understanding, the word ‘could’ can’t
do the work he needs it to. Consider: ‘Could’ Rooney have different beliefs
than the ones he has now? Yes, if, over the course of his life, the formation
of his rational capacities had gone differently—something that ‘could’ have
happened—he would now believe, say, that universalism is true. But no, he
‘could not’ simply choose—contrary to that formation—to change his belief.
Such a change would have to be prompted, e.g., by encountering persuasive
arguments against his position on the internet, assuming his prior formation
would enable him to be persuaded by the persuasive.

Maybe others here will disagree with me (at least to some extent) on what it
is exactly that makes a Christian a Church Father or Mother.  
We’ll see.

The problem is that Fr Rooney himself equovocates over both “hell” and “mortal
sin” to make his argument. He observes universalists deny “hell” (because they
deny it as eternal) and then claims that by denying “hell” (as existing at
all) they deny the reality and consequences of sin, glossing over that he has
changed the definition of hell in the course of making the argument.  
He does the same with “mortal sin”: universalist arguments deny that “mortal
sin” as defined by the Catholic church is possible (i.e. deliberate sin
despite full understanding) and Fr Rooney “refutes” this by saying “mortal
sin” is possible because a degree of culpability is still possible even
without full understanding, thus heterodoxically redefining “mortal sin” as
any degree of culpability at all, and pretending he has countered the argument
that “mortal sin” by the *normal Catholic definition* is impossible.

A point that Rooney fails to clarify here concerns the way in which love—that
is, love in the sense of willing the very best for another—ties the interests
of people together. We see this most clearly, perhaps, in the case of our own
family and close friends, where we may find it somewhat easier to obey the
second of the great commandments (see Matt. 22:39). For according to this
commandment, we are to love others _even as we love ourselves_. If I truly
love my own daughter and love her even as I love myself, then her interests
and my own are so tightly interwoven as to be logically inseparable: any good
that befalls her is then a good that befalls me, and any evil that befalls her
is likewise an evil that befalls me. Or as Jesus himself once expressed a
similar point: “Truly, I say to you, as you did it [i.e., performed acts of
kindness] to one of the least of these my brethren [or loved ones], you did it
to me . . . [and] as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it
not to me” (Matt. 25:40 & 45).

I don’t see much potential for this conversation to be productive so long as
responses continue to be saturated in certain doctrinal presumptions, and it
seems to me that Rooney’s entire project is severely undermined if implied
Catholic precepts are removed and one instead considers basic questions like
“If God is wholly good, could God create a reality in which sentient beings
are sustained in a final and perpetual state of torment?”

If universalism is true (that not only the supposedly “damned” but Satan and
the fallen angels will in the end submit again to the loving service and
worship of the Holy Trinity), it seems perverse that Christ really didn’t
found a Church to bring salvation to all people throughout all ages, or if he
did the Church didn’t get the message (which of course includes ALL the
Fathers who hammered out the canon and the meaning of Scripture) which
perversely speaks to the incompetency of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in guiding
the Church. Especially as that same apostolic Church on which the universalist
relies for the correct canon of Scripture has time and again rejected
universalism, as if perversely the secret, suppressed “true Gospel” has now
been correctively brought to light. The entire record of salvation history
from Genesis to Revelation becomes incoherent — there is no meaningful
symbolical interpretation of any of it, nor stable symbolic language for
theology to operate, and there is no mechanism for any epistemological
certainty upon which one can hold “faith”.

But that there is such a ‘good’, even unknown, that justifies ECT is morally
unimaginable – which gets us back into moral sensibilities. And for all the
reasons Hart notes in the Moral Argument, there are no reasons, no conceivable
goods, that make ECT’s propriety “morally intelligible” (DBH). And remember,
Hart’s Moral Argument requires ex nihilo. If Creation follows from God by
means of some imposition of necessity (either external or internal), the Moral
Argument collapses. Creation must be gratuitous (a term Hart uses a lot to
describe Creation in BOI) and unnecessary in sufficient a manner as to
collapse his ‘goodness’ into the ‘reasons for which’ he freely creates.

This is really just an assertion that universalists cannot prove that God is
love. You are essentially challenging universalists to prove that God is truly
Good. And I suppose this really is a matter of faith and … in the end God will
reveal to all who He truly is.

4\. If you do not really think God’s happiness depends on the happiness of His
creation, then the relation is not literally that one’s interests are tied
together, but some other kind of relation, such as being committed to act in a
certain way. And I concede that God makes nothing in vain, so we can envision
that there are certain expectations in regard to God’s conduct on the basis of
His decision to create something of a given kind. Now, I already denied that
God is committed to ensuring that every particular thing He creates actually
flourishes, as sometimes God has good reasons to allow things like an
evolutionary process which benefits a species but permits the non-flourishing
of individuals. So I think we can conclude, roughly, that God is committed to
ensuring conditions for a given kind to flourish. And on my account of God’s
permission of hell, I already affirmed that God ensures conditions hold in
light of which each individual human being can flourish supernaturally. That
is why an individual human failing to flourish supernaturally is entirely the
fault of that person. But, as the claim God needs to ensure each individual
plant and animal flourishes would be too strong (as ruling out all natural
evils), so too God need not have any obligation to prevent this harm from
occurring – a failure of some individual person to supernaturally flourish –
if God has good justifying reasons to permit it.

Yes, of course. It either is because the soul is not fully aware of him, in
which case God would be taking advantage of non-culpable ignorance or because
he actively prevents that to happen. We already agreed that the rational soul
is naturally drawn to him, so what else would there be for God to cause?
“Love”? You’re introducing unnecessary, additional steps that I don’t
understand, since it’s not at all clear to me in which the acts differ.

‘Hell’ is ordinarily used in the way that it refers to everlasting punishment,
and it was immediately apparent in the context of my article what way I was
using the word. I think it makes no difference and it is certainly not a
‘fatal ambiguity,’ given it is a semantic point of no consequence for any of
these arguments. Call your meaning of hell, ‘hell*’ and mine, ‘hell’ and re-
read my characterization of hard universalism in light of this distinction as
the view that it were impossible for anyone to go to hell, and we’re done –
all my arguments still stand exactly as they were before.

I imagine that what those who invoke the authority of the “consensus of the
Fathers” mean by that little expression is “what the VAST majority of the
Fathers agreed on”, which is… Not that many things, apparently.  
The attributes of God.  
The Trinity.  
The afterlife.  
Judgement.  
A couple more things here and there.  
They also happened to disagree on MANY things too, as I pointed out, so that
granting too much importance on the “consensus” of the Fathers as if it were
infallible or anything close to this… Makes very little sense.

Hi, sorry for the ignorance, but I have a question about how the consensus is
meant yo work: if one Father disagreed with the others, how could there be a
consensus? Is consensus more like democratic election? (such that what is the
object of the consensus is what the majority of the Fathers took to be true)

Secondly, and again, any “revelation” that contradicts itself has proven that
it cannot be of God. So, if a “revelation” claims certain character traits of
its purported divinity and then simultaneously claims that he acts opposite to
that in the most extreme way possible, the revelation is false. If it says God
is good and then attributes him doing what we know to be evil then it is
simply a lie, for it cannot be anything else.

(for instance) even though there’s a few (very few) scientists that don’t
believe in it (the vast majority of whom are fundamentalists), my guess is
that if one or two Fathers disagree with all the others on something, we can
still speak of a consensus.

1\. is the possibility of mortal sin, choosing to love something that is not
God. 2. includes what I just denied (that God will make Himself so present to
you so that it makes it that you could not have done otherwise than love Him).
3. is that God can create a world in which He allows people to resist Him and
does not do things such that it would be impossible for us to do otherwise
than love Him.

So, in terms of demonstrable proof of either possibility, phrased awkwardly as
the “impossibility of showing that X could not be possible,” we are at a
stalemate.

…Yes we do. That reason is **THE ETERNAL TORMENT PERPETULLY BLIGHTING THE
COSMOS!** The hell kind of reasoning interprets literally the worst possible
thing that could happen as evidence that the best is being done?

That, if He allows mortal sin to occur, He would only do so for good reasons –
I am entirely certain as a matter of Christian and theological hope.

Sorry, a mix-up on the negations: “is not among those worlds in which God is
doing what is best for those in the world.”

With respect to the first assumption, an obvious question arises. Just how
should we under­stand the minimal degree of rationality that moral freedom
requires? Although people use such terms as “freedom” and “free will” in a
variety of different ways, virtually everyone seems to agree that we should
exclude lower animals, newborn babies, the severely brain damaged, the
seriously demented, and perhaps even paranoid schizo­phrenics from the precise
kind of freedom that moral responsibility requires. That’s because the
relevant freedom requires an ability to reflect upon and to evaluate one’s own
actions, to draw inferences with some degree of accuracy from one’s own
experience and from the conse­quences of one’s actions, and to learn important
lessons, as the evidence continues to pile up, concerning the conditions of
one’s own happiness. But as with borderline cases in general, it is probably
impossible to say exactly when a maturing child, let us say, becomes rational
enough to advance above the relevant threshold or when someone suffering from
age-related dementia sinks below that threshold. In the case of a woman
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, for example, there need be no exact
instant at which her ever-diminishing rationality removes the last shred of
her remaining freedom; it is enough that at some point she has clearly lost
the ability to make minimally rational judgments and has therefore lost the
ability to act freely.

If God needs no reasons, then God would need no reasons to permit hell – that
seems odd for a universalist to endorse!

If there is no need for sanctifying grace in the sacraments — baptism,
chrismation, confession, Eucharist, Holy Orders, matrimony — because they have
no effect on our final reunion with God (perhaps lessen the pain of
restoration in the afterlife, which seems to be a rather utilitarian bargain)
— then why the Church at all? Why the sacraments? Why the priesthood? Just
follow the teachings of Jesus and try to be a good person.

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: if this is what is meant to be
orthodox Catholicism, then your church deserves to swept into the dustbin of
history.

“It is fallacious (a sort of appeal to future hope) to posit that, if hell is
eternal, it *must* be good for it to be so because God is wholly good.”

I appreciate your rhetoric and good will. Replying here because it was the
nearest reply link to your comment — I think the notion of constant, uniform
dogmatic agreement is somewhat exaggerated — and innovation over time can
become the received opinion. There’s an organic, living creativity that allows
for an orthodoxy to perdure across generations. But I don’t think this implies
there is no such thing as a Church or that Christendom is absolutely separable
from theology or that the latter reduces to a traditional view of hell.
Balthasar was looked at askance for even suggesting that all may be saved, but
evidently he thought the idea compatible with magisterial teaching. There has
been a minority opinion here and there throughout the life of the Church that
held to the universalist view, so I don’t accept the notion that it is an
alien imposition or an intruder into the life of the faithful. (Elsewhere I
replied to your concern that one is faced with an either/or situation with
regards to claims that Christ redeems and renews the entire universe and the
historical praxis of the Church.)

I fully agree with your point about language. A universalist seems to be
talking more about something like “purgatory”, which is not an eternal
condition. I’ve read some of your and others writings on Gehenna, and while I
don’t find it compelling (and indeed problematic that the Lord was only
speaking prophetically of some historical event concerning Jerusalem), I think
I understand your attempt at resolving the tensions in both scripture and some
of the Church Fathers on the question of aion.

Forgive me for my confusion but I do not see how you can both claim that the
“worst possible state” of the human being is non-existence, while
simultaneously denying that an alternative state (eternal punishment) must
necessarily be “‘preferable” to non-existence.

Do you think that, if we learned that God permitted someone to resist loving
Him forever, that is, God did not ever eventually cause that person to love
Him, should we immediately conclude that God is not all-loving and good? Do
you think that, knowing God is Good, there is no possible way for Him to bring
good from eternal resistance of some to His love?

I don’t agree with your statement that inclusivism is the mainstream position.
I would agree that it certainly became more prominent from certain mid 20th
century theologians, and perhaps the importance of ecumenism and inter-
religious dialogue grew after two world wars ripped apart the globe in a
unprecedented manner. I think these are generally good responses to find
common humanity, and common religious and spiritual motivations and
aspirations among all people of good will albeit diverse faiths.

Instead, I think your follow-up comments about predestination show that you
are operating in a false dilemma. For example, you allege that in a world
where God permits hell He would be “actively and maliciously choosing to to
ship people on a conveyor belt to hell for literally no reason before they
were born.” But, as you might recall from my CLJ article, I explicitly and
repeatedly argue that this assumption is false or at least can be rejected by
defenders of the orthodox picture of hell. On that picture (held by the
Catholic and Orthodox tradition), Calvinistic theological determinism is
false, and God does nothing to make it the case that anyone goes to hell,
neither causing them to resist His love eternally nor denying them something
without which they could not avoid ending up in hell. I do not need to give
any reason for which God does allow hell in order for it to be clear,
logically, that if theological determinism were false, your claim that God
would be ‘actively and maliciously’ causing people to go to hell in every
world where He permitted hell would also be false.

The universalist should be ok with this, and not demand to be received as
orthodox. There have always been heterodox theologies, forcefully and
intelligently and competently argued for, which the institutional Church(es)
have rejected. We’ll see clearly in the final consummation: for now we see
darkly, as through a glass.

Yeah, I’m tiring of this “debate.” There are so many more interesting topics
in Christianity and spirituality in general.

Note first the apparent assumption in the first two sentences of this
quotation that if “it is a necessary truth that all will [eventually] be
saved,” then “it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell.” But as it
stands, that is a simple _non sequitur_. If hell itself, however else we might
understand its nature, serves a corrective purpose in the divine scheme of
things or even serves as a means of bringing sinners back to Christ, as many
Christian universalists believe it does, then it hardly follows that no
sinners will ever go there. So the claim that no one will remain in hell
_forever_ must obviously be distinguished from the claim that no one will ever
go there in the first place.

Fr. Rooney then concludes his article with this …  
“This (Christian) story does not require that any human being ends up in hell
forever, but it clearly requires the possibility of free and fully informed
rejection of God’s love, and thus the possibility of hell, even if nobody ends
up there.”

A second word to all commentators: the attacks on the Roman Catholic Church
stop now!

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and damnation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soteriological mission of cross and resurrection, not
as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From the
beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

> God is not a finite being in whom the distinction of freedom from necessity

> in its proper end; and God’s infinite freedom is the eternal fulfillment of

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. However, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attributing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything determines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

> Dionysius’ presentation of God as productive Love raises the much-vexed
> question of whether, for Dionysius, God makes all things “freely” or “by
> necessity.” The entire issue is almost always misconceived, because it is
> usually assumed that to say that God creates “freely” means that he “might
> not create,” and that he “chooses” between possible alternatives to creating
> and not creating; while, conversely, to say that there is no such choice
> between possible alternatives, that God “cannot” not create, means that he

> _Theophany_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791471128/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN91471128&linkIdÇb04e61e77e1c94bd9703fe2dee3af0),
> p. 49)

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

> God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before us, that we shall
> see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new
> heavens and the new earth, in every created thing which shall then exist;
> and also by the body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision of
> the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. (DCD XXII, 29)

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

[St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible? →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-

possible/)

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

> Certainly there was an Eden on this very unhappy earth. We all long for it,
> and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least
> corrupted, its gentlest and most humane, is still soaked with the sense of
> “exile.”

_Christ is risen from the dead,_  
_Trampling down death by death,_  
_And upon those in the tombs_  
_Bestowing life!_

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

_We have seen the true light!_  
_We have received the heavenly Spirit!_  
_We have found the true Faith!_  
_Worshipping the undivided Trinity,_  
_who has saved us._

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

> A properly theological cosmology and ‘history of salvation—the economy or
> the plan of salvation—begins with the Passion of Christ, and from this
> vantage point looks backwards and forwards to see everything in this light.9

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

> The Lord is my portion;  
>  I promise to keep thy words.  
>  I entreat thy favor with all my heart;  
>  be gracious to me according to thy promise.  
>  When I think of thy ways,

>  I hasten and do not delay  
>  to keep thy commandments.  
>  Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,  
>  I do not forget thy law.  
>  At midnight I rise to praise thee,

>  I am a companion of all who fear thee,  
>  of those who keep thy precepts.

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

> For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you,
> neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will
> go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?”
> Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea
> for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?” But the word is
> very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.
> (Dt 30:11-14)

> And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I
> teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of
> the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you. (Dt 4:1)

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

> Mortality, in fact, seems to be regarded as natural in the Old Testament.
> There are a couple of exceptions to the normal mortality of humans—Enoch
> (Gen 5.24) and Elijah (2 Kgs 2)—but they are the exceptions which prove the
> rule. In the Old Testament, death is not ubiquitously seen as a curse or a
> punishment for sin. In fact, the death of figures such as Abraham, whose
> lives are of significance for the unfolding of the narrative, are described
> in blessed terms: he “breathed his last and died in good old age, an old man
> and full of years, and was gathered to his people” (Gen 25.8). Such a death,
> surrounded by children and their children, and completed with a proper
> burial, is seen as natural and right, a completion and fulfillment, and,
> indeed, even grants the perpetuity of the deceased’s name: “The days of a
> good life are numbered, but a good name endures forever” (Sir 41.13).2

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

[3] Claude Montefiore, “[Rabbinic Judaism and the Epistles of St
Paul](https://www.scribd.com/document/345232762/Rabbinic-Judaism-and-the-
Epistles-of-St-Paul),” _Jewish Quarterly Review_ 13 (January 1901): 19.

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

One might conceivably see _passio essendi_ as being lacking will, but I think
it is better to see it as a compact, elemental gift from which all other
powers derive. It is not so much a lack of freedom as a richness that includes
a joyous reception of being that grounds reason and will. I take it that the
libertarian objection is that somehow authentic freedom would require,
contradictorily, a lack of metaphysical freedom or some quality of the
indeterminate in order to remain free, but this is just to posit freedom
wrongly to begin with.

As it happens, I number among my friends and acquaintances some of the
greatest scholars of Orthodox canons and councils and history in the world;
and to a man they would assert that the Orthodox Church–no matter what the
inclinations of its catechists and prelates may have been down the ages–has
never definitively condemned universalism as such, or even addressed it under
any synodical or conciliar conditions of special import. It has condemned some
teachings that are also, as it happens, universalist. But the sort of
universalism found in Gregory and Isaac, which fully acknowledges the reality
of judgment and hell, has never even been addressed.

How all that sorts out is ultimately a matter of trust and seeing in a mirror
darkly.

Thus Silouan’s famous rebuke of the hermit who gleefully rejoiced in the
eternal punishment of atheists: “Love could not bear that. We must pray for
all.” Similarly, when asked by Olivier Clement what would happen if a person
does not agree to open his or her heart and accept the love of God, Sophrony
replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell, Christ will
remain there with him.”

Dale, you may find my multi-article review of Tom Talbott’s book _The
Inescapable Love of God_ of interest. Several of these articles address New
Testament texts. The results are often surprising. And the comment threads are
quite interesting, too! <https://goo.gl/BrsRp9>

_____, “[The Greater Hope: How do I find a God who triumphs over evil and
death](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/05/19/the-greater-hope-how-do-i-
find-a-god-who-triumphs-over-evil-and-death/)”

Well, its perfect harmonization with, restoration to, and ultimate
indistinction from the natural will. But, then, that is not elimination, but
rather salvation.

Perhaps my fears are inspired by versions of universalism I’ve encountered in
which people imagine God instantaneously kicking the doors of our hearts open
and blasting all falsehood away, essentially leaving us no other option but
God, in which circumstance we ‘make the right choice’. I confess I find it
difficult to believe God would be very interested in our coming to conclude he
is our only option under such conditions. But that doesn’t seem to be
anybody’s position here.

I suppose we all for that. But, really, no citing if crucial texts in dubious
translations–that must be a rule. If Gregory of Nyssa talks of Judas suffering
“eis ton aiona,” then quote him as doing so, as well as the many instances
where he makes clear how he understands that biblical phrase. “Unto infinity”
forsooth. One of the first things to learn about Gregory is that every version
of “infinite” in Greek–apeiron, aperilepton, eyc–is a privileged name for the
divine nature. _Die Unendlichkeit Gottes bei Gregor von Nyssa_ (E. Mühlenberg)
might have been one of the earliest books I read on Gregory’s metaphysics,
flawed though that book is.

Unfortunately, we lack an in-depth treatment of patristic eschatology
available in English. Perhaps such a work would be too much for any single
scholar; or perhaps someone has written such a volume, and it just hasn’t been
translated. Fortunately, we do have Brian Daley’s “handbook,” as he calls it.
Published in 2002, it remains the go-to book on the eschatological views of
the Church Fathers. It does need to be updated, though, in light of the recent
scholarly contributions of Ilaria Ramelli.

Resistance was futile. I’ve just been compelled (in Borg-like fashion) to
purchase the Devil and Pierre. 3 pages in … Screwtape on crack?

Or, who are you? “Brian” isn’t that uncommon a name. Tell me, are you Brian
Blessed (my favorite living Brian)?

Both “never” and “forever” are awfully big words. Could a finite and imperfect
being be envisioned as having the constancy to refuse through an infinity of
time? Scripture seems to describe the sinful man as wavering. I shortcircuits
my thinking to try to posit such an infinite and firmly consistent refusal on
the part of a finite, flawed, and inconstant being such as we all are.

As for Dogen, the issue of enlightenment (or, technically, awakening) is a
somewhat different issue. But, of course, you are right that knowledge of
anything is not merely a discursive mastery of its attributes, but an
encounter, an intellectual intuition, in which there must be a surfeit of
mystery, or in which the intellect falls silent in being subsumed into…well,
ideally love. That is the yield of apophatic discipline in Maximus, after all.

The relation of divine providence and divine foreknowledge is a difficult,
perhaps intractable, problem, especially for classical theists but also for
modern theists who desire to remain within the mainstream Christian tradition.
This is not an easy piece, but it does shed light and is well worth the read.
At the very least it demonstrates how difficult it is to reconcile eternal
damnation with a God who is benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.

“Rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in a
kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny.”

Part of the difficulty is that one should not isolate freedom and identity as
if one could focus purely on the individual. There’s the story in the
Brother’s Karamazov about the old woman in hell who once gave an onion to a
beggar. An angel tries to pull her out from infernal chains by the strength of
that single act of charity. Other souls try to cling to her and gain release
as well, and the old woman shouts, “it’s mine, mine” — and tumbles back into
the flames, of course. There is also Father Zossima’s mysterious claim that
“each is responsible for all.” This can only be an irrational puzzle for those
who have imbibed the ethos of modern, western individualism. But if the Triune
God is the exemplar of what it means to be a person, our creaturely experience
is analogous and only partially, incompletely, imperfectly approaches genuine
personhood.

Unlike the Latin Fathers, many of the Eastern Fathers believed that when
Christ descended to hades, he saved all of its inhabitants. This universality
of the Lord’s paschal work is also reflected in the Orthodox Church’s hymnody.
This is one reason why the greater hope simply will not go away in Orthodoxy.

So, rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in
a kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny. I maintain that the original gift of being
involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some level,
but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream, play,
wonder, creativity and loving encounter. It’s hard to talk about and
impossible to comprehend. I take it that all our acts of compassion, of
delight, discovery, and insight are those which bring us closer to who we are
meant to be. Also, doubtless, we all fail to attain this calling. Some fail
miserably. I understand the parable of the sheep and goats to be largely
intrapersonal in nature.

Gregory MacDonald is the pseudonym for Robin Parry, who has a Ph.D. in Old
Testament studies. Parry looks at the primary New Testament texts that are
typically invoked in the eternal hell vs. universalism debate. You may be
surprised by how well the new Testament reads when liberated from a prior
dogmatic commitment to the classical doctrine of hell. Parry’s exegesis is
thoughtful, careful, and imaginative. He does not claim more for his
interpretation of a given text than it can bear; but he does invite us to a
fresh re-reading of the Bible through a hermeneutic of love.

Will read that sermon between chapters of the Devil and Pierre! I like the
subtle threat of hell to those alone who would use it to terrorize — no need
for iron in paradise — the kind of rhetorical reversal we see in Christ’s
parables.

Having read your series, it seems like St. Isaac believes in pre-destination.
I wonder how he would have reacted to the conversation between Ivan and
Alyosha in Brothers K?

Weighing in at over 900 pages, this is a massive work of first-rate
scholarship on the theme of universal salvation in the first millennium
Christian Church. This book is now mandatory reading for anyone who wishes to
advance an opinion about what the Church Fathers believed and taught. You will
be surprised. The universalist hope was far more prevalent than I ever knew.
It was not restricted to Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa. Even St Augustine
apparently believed in a form of apocatastasis early in his episcopal career.
Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the standard
teaching of everlasting perdition became the teaching of the Church.

If human beings are made by God and for God, if the Holy Trinity is their
ultimate Good, only in whom they may find the happiness they desire toward
whom their consciousness is teleologically directed, then we may not entertain
the possibility that they could irrevocably close themselves off to Love.
God’s salvific will cannot be eternally stymied. _That All Shall Be Saved_ has
brought apokatastasis back to the catholic table. See my series which seeks to
explicate Hart’s arguments: “[Apprehending
Apokatastasis](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/apprehending-
apokatastasis-the-incoherence-of-everlasting-perdition/).”

A brilliant exposition of the critical assertion in Sergius Bulgakov’s
universalist eschatology that at the Second Coming all will love Christ.

Thanks for this list Fr. Aidan. I am firmly into the concept that Met. Ware
has expressed. I hope for the salvation of all mankind. However, I believe
that Satan and the demons have already been judged and condemned to
annihilation in the Lake of Fire which is prepared for them. God has waited to
carry out their execution because he wants to save all humanity if possible.
The Church Fathers who believed that Satan and the demons would be saved have
no basis in Holy Scripture and the acts of Satan and the demons to base their
teaching on. Where there is no repentance, there is not life.

Honestly, what you describe expresses where I’m at (though my questions might
suggest otherwise). As you say, “True freedom as the perfected flourishing of
one’s being is an eschatological fruition that can be anticipated insofar as
one’s actions bring one closer to the unique gift of one’s being/vocation
granted by the creator God.” No objection here. I’m perfectly happy viewing
“freedom” as you describe and for the reasons you give.

The universalist views of Origen and St Gregory Nyssen are well known, but
what about St Maximus the Confessor. Andreapoulos believes that strands of
Maximus’s eschatology intimate an openness to the universalist vision, despite
the damnation passages that can be found in the Maximian corpus. Andreapoulos
points to Maximus’s conviction that every human being will experience an
eschatological healing of his gnomic will. When the Good is fully manifested
in the _parousia_ of Christ, why would anyone reject the Good?

And tonight I read the parallel passage in MacDonald’s sermon, “Love your
neighbor,” that DBH referred us to. It sounds so similar to your heart and got
me thinking, too, that if Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and
FOREVER, then the parable of the lost sheep is a potent universalist passage!
So MacDonald:

But I cannot put dismiss Sergius Bulgakov’s suggestion that it is the world
that allows Satan to entertain his delusion that God is not his true good. But
eventually he will be expelled from the world and deprived of the world. He
will no longer have the world to “feed” on. At this point “Satan’s duel with
God begins,” Bulgavkov writes. “Can we, human beings, know anything about this
duel?”

Bernier is a Byzantine Catholic theologian. In this thoughtful piece, he asks
the question why should we question the doctrine of everlasting damnation. His
answer is blunt: we must question it because it is “mon­strous, plain and
simple.”

Bulgakov’s famous essay in which he argues for the final redemption of the
fallen angels. His argument is similar to that the argument he presents for
the universal salvation of humanity in _Bride of the Lamb_ , yet he also
recognizes that it will be accomplished differently because of the differences
between angelic spirits and embodied human beings made in the _Imago Dei_. The
salvation story of Satan can only begin when he has been cast out of the world
into the void.

Cheers.

Brad’s book is perhaps the best book on hell that I have read

The publication of _That All Shall Be Saved_ in 2019 was a major event. It
pushed the question of universal salvation to the theological front-burner.
The majority of online reviews, though, suggest that the brethren would rather
dismiss the universalist thesis as outright heresy rather than engage it
constructively and substantively. Fortunately all is not lost.

A collection of essays discussing the universalist hope articulated by various
theologians in the history of the Church, from Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa
to Sergius Bulgakov, and Karl Barth. Tom Talbott’s piece on George MacDonald
is of particular interest. A helpful and instructive volume.

William Lane Craig has sought to rebut the claim that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if there is a hell by suggesting that they will be so
enraptured by their vision of God that they will not give the damned a second
thought. But how is this not a failure to love?

May I turn the question back upon yourself? If God were to say to one of two
things to you, either “My dear Yaakov, I love you ultimately and absolutely
and I will always find a way to turn your heart to me, no matter what” or
“Yaakov, you are right, only you will perish and there’s nothing I can do to
save you,” which word would you find most encouraging, most transformative?

Fr Coleman, that is fascinating news! I had heard that Hart had been
commissioned to translate the NT (or the entire Bible?). I hope that Hart will
eventually share with the rest of us the conclusions of his study.

And, had our our Lord spoken of everlasting punishment, that would be an
interesting argument. But he did not speak English, and in fact did not speak
Greek; and the Greek text of Matthew 25:46 (which is the only one you can have
in mind) has been read by a great many Greek-speaking and Syriac-speaking
fathers, from the earliest days, as saying nothing of the sort.

_I have not read everything on the universalist hope, nor have I read all of
the books and articles that others deem essential. But I thought it might be
helpful to others to share the essential stuff that I have read and found
helpful:_

Also it seems to me what you are saying is logically confused. Given certain
assumptions about God (the ones being made in this thread), either God is the
final Good (Good in itself) or he is not. This means that the argument you
cannot avail yourself of is God is the final Good and something else is the
final Good as well. It amounts to saying there are two Gods. But if that is
right, then, strangely enough, there are no Gods, because something cannot be
God, as we understand him, and something else also be God. It amounts to
saying A and ~A which is logically contradictory. Moreover, if both are the
Good in itself, then it seems reasonable to suppose that they are essentially
identical which, according to a decent metaphysical principle, means there is
one final Good, not two.

At the end of his life, the notable Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson came
to affirm universal salvation. For those acquainted with his theology, this
was not a surprise. The entirety of his project inevitably points to this
conclusion.

Hayes synthesizes Catholic reflection on the last things over the past 50-60
years. This book is helpfully read alongside Ratzinger’s _Eschatology_.

He’s ever so much more than an actor. He’s a natural phenomenon as grand, in
his way, as Niagara Falls or Mt Fuji.

Much of Walls’s philosophical career has been devoted to matters
eschatological. In this 2015 book he pulls together his reflections for a
popular audience. It is clearly written, accessible, and affordable—highly
recommended. Also see my [multi-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/jerry-walls-heaven-hell-and-
purgatory/). For more in-depth treatment, read Walls scholarly trinity
(below).

I have always liked Mr. Blessed’s work. It cheers my heart to hear this.

Ummm… and I don’t mean to upset David, who is a friend and wonderful
theologian and philosopher (and thank God for that- I go mad wishing to help
Polkinghorne with some understanding of epistemology) but he writes splendidly
with his futuristic computer thing!

Our creation in Christ has made us, by vocation, into beings to whom the
Father is as essential as he is, by paternity, to the Son himself. But we
should not forget the other face of this mystery, whereby we appear, in
Christ, as eternally irreplaceable to the Father as the Son is to him.
Confronted with the suicidal decision to reverse into hatred the love for
which we have all been created and which makes us, in the Father’s eyes,
inseparable from the person of his Son, could God, even out of respect for our
freedom, abandon forever the person who destroys himself in the self-torture
of his aberration? How could he do so, this God who, in Christ wishes to raise
us by pure grace to his likeness, and promises to share with us the life of
his uncreated Son? Such is the choice of the unfathomable depth of his love
for us. Henceforth there is no human rule, no safeguard of morality that can
prohibit God from loving madly the madman who believes that in order to exist
he must refrain from loving him who is love itself! God’s remedy for madness
consists then in bringing into play all the resources of his love to help the
rebel overcome his insane refusal to love. For what kind of God would he be
who, despite being declared all-powerful, was forever incapable of releasing
from his mortal spell a freedom that was received without being requested, and
that could become a snare of pain and hatred to its recipient, for all
eternity?

Of course, one can then get into the old wrangles between Thomists and
Scotists over the priority of intellect or will in knowing God. And the
Scotists are routinely misrepresented in that regard, since for them intellect
is not the same as reason and will is not the same as spontaneous arbitrium;
both are rational movements of the soul. And really, after all, both are
really one and the same movement; they are not genuinely separable faculties.
Intellect is informed because it is intentional, and therefore has a natural
velleity towards the world and towards the transcendental horizon of truth.
Will is a rational movement towards a perceived end, and therefore naturally
follows (as best it can) the light of intellect. There really is no need here
to assign priority: the final end is a kingdom of love and knowledge, the two
proving to be infinitely identical

It’s not doubtful in the Orthodox Church — it is only very recently that you
could cite any Orthodox writers who have espoused universalism. The only
reason St. Gregory of Nyssa’s teachings on this subject (if in fact he ever
taught such a thing) were not condemned by that council was because it was
argued that the quotes you refer to were origenistic interpolations. There is
a similar argument that the quotes from St. Isaac of Syria you refer to are
not his genuine writings. However, even if we grant, for the sake of argument,
that these quotes are authentically the work of those saints, there is zero
evidence that the Church ever embraced those ideas, and mountains of evidence
that they rejected them. The odd opinion of one saint or another does not
trump an ecumenical council. One need only read the patristic commentaries on
Matthew 25:45 “And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life” to see whether the Church thinks that when our
Lord speaks of everlasting punishment, he really mean everlasting punishment.

I am not good at web-exchanges, since I don’t like being on the computer, and
these days I don’t have much energy. So you may have to wait for my next book
for my answer. But two quick answers:

Ah, yes, I like this:  
“Perhaps God pursue us ‘as long as it takes’?”  
For many decades I have inclined toward a universalist view, pretty much since
reading Hosea Ballou’s “Ancient History of Universalism” (a mid-19th century
volume that I still have, buried somewhere in my library). “Inclined” as I do
not believe there is adequate conclusive evidence, either in Scripture or
Tradition, that any of us are qualified to claim knowledge of what is the
reality of “the other side”. I do believe in Hell, but I don’t know what I
believe about it. I do believe in the possibility of a permanent rejection of
God, but find it very difficult to believe that anyone (even including him
that once was Lucifer) can hold out against increasing knowledge through all
eternity,  
and I have become convinced that something resembling Purgatory has a far
greater likelihood than does an eternal hell. God’s mercy is infinite, He
desireth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should live. All that
being said, the operative thought is that we simply cannot know, not having
been conclusively told, but that we can certainly trust and hope in that
boundless mercy. It is not so much what we do with our free will, but what
Jesus has done on the Cross that matters. If He has declared us saved, so we
are, but if our flawed and twisted will has not accepted that, perhaps his
call and his teaching will ultimately bring us to a place of healing. There is
time enough and more. Perhaps it’s like what my Dad always said about how he
came to be married: “She kept on chasing me … until I caught her.”  
cf. Francis Thomson’s. “Hound of Heaven”>

The figure of Judas Iscariot has long captured the imagination of Christians,
even begetting poems and songs. Hart reflects on one forgotten poem by a
forgotten English poet, Robert Buchanan. If Jesus is love, is he not awaiting
the return of his friend and disciple at the messianic banquet?

Roberto De La Noval, “[We Shall See Him As He Is: Bulgakov On Eschatological
Conversion](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/we-shall-see-him-as-he-
is-bulgakov-on-eschatological-conversion/).”

The One Purpose of God: An Answer to the Doctrine of Eternal Punishment by Jan
Bonda

“But it is a wild question. God is, and shall be, All in all. Father of our
brothers and sisters! You will not be less glorious than we, taught of Christ,
are able to think You. When You go into the wilderness and seek, You will not
come home until you have found. It is because we hope not for them in You, not
knowing Your love, that we are so hard and so heartless to the brothers and
sisters You have given us.”

Totally agree with DBH’s point that our truest freedom is a will at rest in
God as its telos—where God is desired and intended in all things. And of
course I’d agree that wrestling someone to the ground who intends to set
themselves afire is not an intervention in their freedom.

I’m fascinated by the force of fiction to open a way to such hope: Would CS
Lewis, Great Divorce count, as least as the first step across the bridge?

True. But which of my books, I ask myself, do you mean? Buy them all, I say.

But I would still say that the final formulation about epistemic ignorance is
defective. Taken to its logical terminus it would mean that we are free to the
degree that we are ignorant, whereas the point is that we become more free as
we progress away from illusion towards the Good as such and the fulfillment of
our nature. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Father,
forgive them, they know not what they do. Etc. And the highest freedom is
achieved when we at last see so clearly that there is no need for choice,
because union in love has been reached.

Here is my book-length treatment of the subject: [The Biblical Case for
Everyone Going to Heaven](http://wp.me/PNthc-i6)

For almost a millennia the Latin Church has taught that at the moment of death
the eternal destiny of the individual is definitively and irrevocably settled.
This doctrine is known as the [particular
judgment](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm). But the Eastern Church
has retained the older belief that the destiny of the damned is not settled
until the final judgment. Until then, salvation is still possible through the
prayers of the Church for the departed.

My question (possibly related to your comment above on the gnomic will and its
ultimate indistinction from the natural will) has to do with created agency as
fulfilled in Christ and enjoying a ‘scope of loving possibilities’ within
which to freely/creatively determine how it shall reflect divine beauties.
Going with Certeau’s suggestion, might we imagine the logoi of created beings
as embodying or specifying a “range” or “scope” (a pallet?) of beautiful
expression and not the particular of every form? The divine will (or logoi)
would terminate not in the final form of creaturely expression but in the
range of creative possibilities offered to creatures to uniquely shape their
expressive form (unique not in the creation of beauties not already comprised
in Christ as the summum bonum, but simply as the creature’s contribution to
the consummate beauty of ends synergistically achieved). Would the gnomic will
retain a unique function in this case?

On p. 320, with reference to Michel de Certeau’s “Authorités Chrétiennes et
Structures Sociales,” you concede the possibility that in our final fulfilled
form Christ offers (in Certeau’s words) “a style of existence that ‘allows’
for a certain kind of creativity and that opens a new series of experiences”
as opposed to, say, Christ specifying every particular of our continuing
existence without remainder (even if, as you say, Christ comprises the
fullness of every contingent expression).

But also, and perhaps a bigger misunderstanding for me, is, isn’t universalism
deterministic, does it not require one to be mongerstic, where does free
agency come in, if we can boldly say that all WILL be saved, rather than
reserving judgment and saying all MAY be saved, for if even only one is
allowed his freedom and chooses to shrink away from the humanity and divinity
he was created for, in essence, in hell, moving in the opposite direction of
theosis. Would this not then render universalism false? This of course
presupposing synergism, whereas if we say all WILL be, then are we not
mongerist? Is it not simple the moral form of determinism?

I see St. Silouan being cited all over the place as a Universalist. I’m
confused. Based on my reading (some time ago), his famous prayer was “all
creation will be saved, and I alone will perish”. I just don’t see how this is
espousing Unversalism – he is exluding himself.

There is also a Russian and a Greek parish in the Princeton area, but they
have very few converts.

Focusing on St Paul, Talbott invites us to read the Scriptures afresh,
temporarily bracketing our infernalist suppositions. We might be surprised by
what we find.

Origen did NOT invent the doctrine of universal salvation. Going back to the
second century there existed a position that may be described as “intercessory
universalism.”

2) If it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s gift throughout their
whole life in this world, why is it not possible for a human person to
continue to do so after he or she has has died? I suppose, ultimately, I don’t
understand why, if it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s offer
once, it is not possible for them to refuse it on and on for the rest of their
existence. I don’t in anyway think that people must do that. I don’t see why
it’s not a possibility though.

The truth shall set you free! It is our ignorance that leaves us to make
inferior choices.

And do you believe he really believed he was headed for eternal perdition? It
is a wonderful statement of humility and hope, not a prophecy.

You may be interested to know that I was a typical Evangelical, believing that
either heaven or hell was the destination of every human being, but came to
believe that everyone is going to heaven strictly by reading the Bible. That
is, I have never read a book on Universalism – either before or after I came
to this conclusion.

This 3-article series represents a recently revised and expanded blog version
of the above Cardiff lecture. How does apokatastasis shape and inform our
preaching of the gospel? How does it fit in with the Orthodox understanding of
Church as manifestation of the Kingdom?

Somewhere in my library I have a mid-19thC volume of interest: “The Ancient
History of Universalism”, by Hosea Ballou. Ballou was a consistent Calvinist
who came to modify his position by a belief in universal election, and went on
to found the Universalist Church, which, regrettably developed to an extreme
liberalism and has merged with the Unitarians. His book is interesting, adding
to a Scriptural exposition a surprising knowledge of patristics. I’ve read it
through more than once, and find myself not convinced of universalism as a
doctrine. I don’t think we can go that far. But it did leave me ready to hold
a universalist hope similar to many of those you quote.

I’m already on thin ice, but heck, why not? If your reply shatters the ice
beneath my feet and I disappear into the watery darkness below, I’ll see you
all on the other side anyway because universalism is true!

Greetings, Stanford. Thanks for the suggestion about Dame Julian. I
intentionally omitted her from my list because I have come across two Julian
scholars who deny her universalism. Most recently, see Denys Turner’s book
[_Julian of Norwich,
Theologian_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030019255X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=030019255X&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20).
I tend to trust Turner’s judgment–hence my reluctance to include Julian in my
list. What do you think?

Dale directed me here to see if his recollections of our conversations were
accurate. They are not quite…

If you happen to visit these comments again, I am curious to know your
response to those who claim that the belief in universalism is a heresy since
it was (supposedly) condemned by the fifth ecumenical council.

“Simply said, all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will
reach that end, and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption
prevents them; but rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still,
willy-nilly, all natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as
bliss or torment, but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot
not convert the will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will
never be all in all and creation will never be completed. That teleological
understanding of the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be
forced into the categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I
honestly wish Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories
for that reason.”

To the list of “Julian was NOT a universalist” scholars you may add Fr. John
Julian, OJN, whose translation and commentary are published by Paraclete Press
under the title “The Complete Julian of Norwich”. Among other things, he
points out that she frequently used the phrase “all who shall be saved”,
implying that not all will be saved. Certainly she was not an avowed
universalist as were Saints Gregory of Nyssa of Isaac the Syrian. However, I
think she was so in pectore, but given the doctrinal and ecclesiastical
climate of Fourteenth Century England, she could only lead her reader to that
truth inferentially. And I think she does so beautifully.

I’m not a trained philosopher (which you know by now), and if the Analytic
tradition inherently violates some law of transcendence, then OK. Obviously
that tradition has been employed to deny transcendence. But analytic thinkers
can employ the standard categories to affirm transcendence as well, no? (Denys
Turner perhaps?) But, as far your comments in the quote go, it looks to me
like you employ the categories you want equally to dismiss—i.e., all things
are “determined” to a “final cause,” “rational nature” can interrupt itself,
and “teleology” drives the process. Are not these terms standard analytic-
talk?

Thanks for the response, Mr. Hart. I do think it’s a helpful clarification
about God, and I think I agree with your basic description of God as man’s
final end.

If I have questions, they are not about “freedom” as you’ve described it. They
are about the nature of the words “insofar as one’s actions bring one closer
to….” Is there not a conversation to be had here, i.e., about what sort of
agency or action it is which is the means by which we are to become free?
That’s what I’ve been inquiring after, and it’s only with respect to this that
I’d cautiously employ a term like “libertarian”; not to describe a proper
final mode or resting place for the will, but only to understand the nature of
the agency or action by which means we become free (and thus free of
‘libertarian’ becoming).

My point is just that this journey, this movement toward our telos in God,
requires a synergy in which the specific human ‘yes’ and ‘no’ we render are
not guarantees entailed God’s actions in/toward us (which I tend to see
universalists appeal to in order get a clear terminus ad quem). Thus my
concern with ‘epistemic distance’. Some ignorance is a ‘good’ thing, because
it makes creaturely becoming in the Good possible.

Oh, I should have noted: the first anathema of “Origen” is clearly phrased:
what is rejected is a restoration whose premise is the pre-existent state of
souls, such that all things must return to the original state, without
personal or natural differentiation of souls. That is why it speaks of the
restoration “that follows from” or is “consequent upon” that pre-existence. I
think we often fail to appreciate that, even as late as the fifth council,
there were still too many of the “holy fathers” and too many participants in
the council who, at least sub rosa reservationis, held to an eventual
salvation of all for an outright and unambiguous condemnation of universal
salvation to have been possible.

I now see that David responded to that in his comments above. Thank you.

Good points too. I certainly don’t want to boil theosis down to an exchange of
bits of information. So I’ll work on fine-tuning the distinction I’m aiming at
here. My gut tells me there’s a legit (liceitous? Adjective please?) concern
about created agency here (that it not be overwhelmed unto determinism). But
as I’m reading you, you’re not simply positing in a postmortem context the
kind of, say, compatibilist determination of human choice you reject
presently, supposing that God resorts to perfecting human beings postmortem in
a fundamentally different way than at present.

My over all problem with all will be saved, is that the agape we know in God
the Holy Trinity is not coercive.

As a former Protestant, I can testify to the radical difference (at least
existentially) between living in the cacophony of the confessions, which
distinguished and perpetrated divisions and prescribed bounded sets as to what
we had to believe (including infernalism) … vis-a-vis my Orthodox experience
of the creeds as centered sets around which we unify, which also limit what we
may impose on others and allow for a freedom of theological thought and
discourse (that I see here).

May I identify myself as a former evangelical denominational pastor, executive
officer and Bible College president. I’ve been in active Christian ministry
for 64 years and continue a preaching assignment every Sunday. I embraced the
truth of universal salvation after many years of biblical study, research and
prayer. With this revelation my entire concept of God’s loving relationship to
humanity has been revolutionized.

Do you enjoy analytic philosophical reflection on the hell? You’ll find a
number of interesting essays in this volume, including a piece by Talbott on
free will and character formation and a piece by Jerry Walls on
annihilationism. Check out the table of contents on the Amazon page.

The example of the Bodhisattva is always in the back of my mind. Shantideva’s
Bodhicaryavatara should be required reading for all Christian theologians.
Technically, in the Mahayana–of any inflection (my favorite being Yogacara or
Citta matra, but that’s neither here nor there), the Bodhisattva does not
refuse enlightenment. He is, in fact, fully awakened. But, out of the
superabundance of his metta (compassionate love) and karuna (mercy), he vows
not to “pass over” into Nibbana until all other sentient beings are ushered
in. And this very act is the supreme enlightenment, because in being set free
from tanha absolutely by his compassion he learns that “Samsara and Nibbana
are one”–for, in the eyes of charity, paradise is the compassion that prompts
the great vow.

If you’re just beginning to reflect on eternal damnation, this may be the book
with which to begin. Four Protestant scholars present the retributive,
annihilationist, free will, and universalist positions and respond to the
contributions of the others. Robin Parry’s essay on universalism is
particularly fine.

Either we have free will now with the ability to permanently and eternally
reject God, and God efficaciously and therefore irresistibly changes the human
will in the eschaton to choose God permanently, *OR* we don’t have free will
now, and the change that God does upon us in the eschaton gives us will that
is truly free and we thus choose God freely for eternally.

Well, honestly, I know of no universalist of the classical variety who
suggests anything other than that purgative regeneration of the will. I am not
sure what the issue is.

A helpful introduction to universalist reflection in the patristic Church,
with special focus on Origen, St Gregory of Nazianzus, and St Gregory of
Nyssa.

Chenoweth surveys the key texts in St Maximus’s writings and concludes that if
he was not an outright universalist, he was certainly sympathetic to it.
Superficially Maximus appears to have affirmed universal damnation, yet there
are many elements in his theology that point to apokatastasis.

I live in Atlanta, have for many years, but my heart is in Western New York
where I grew up.  
Academia avoided me as much as I avoided it, though I was never really keen to
participate.  
Petty, corrupt, earnest about the wrong things, if it’s ever right to be
earnest, and uninterested in what really matters. The only actual career I can
ever remember wanting doesn’t really qualify, I suppose. At some point early
in my youth I wanted to be Capt. Kirk. Not an astronaut, mind you, just
Captain Kirk. (I am a year older than you, btw.) I work as a drudge grading
SAT essays for a national tutoring company. This allows me to eat and to feed
my old Persian cat and the many ferals that I somehow became benefactor to. I
write on Father Kimel’s blog, because he is a terrific priest and I rarely
find a place with an atmosphere congenial to my tastes. I have not attempted
to be published anywhere. When I can find the energy, I work on fiction,
because I think what the world needs is better images to nurture a more true
understanding. I don’t generally get too far with it, but it keeps me
relatively sane.

Oh, by the way, Capon was not a universalist. He believes that it is possible
for the sinner, like the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son, to
stand outside the festivities of the kingdom. Like C. S. Lewis, Capon
advocates a free-will model of damnation. Might it be possible for the damned
to repent of their rejection of the divine mercy? Perhaps. All moments in time
are eternally held within the spear wound of Christ and thus eternally
available to the damned for their exploration and reassessment.

Andreano explores what Origen really taught about the eternal destiny of
Satan. Some fascinating material here. After you’ve read this, read Bulgakov’s
essay “On the Question of the Apocatastasis of the Fallen Spirits.” Makes for
an interesting comparison.

Wonderful quotation, Brad. Thanks for sharing it. And thanks for the link to
the Turnicev article.

Even if there is no such thing as efficacious grace by which God can
unilaterally convert the wicked, philosopher Eric Reitan argues that their
salvation is statistically certain, as long as God continues to offer his
forgiveness after death.

“We need to understand human being and agency not as a limit to God—created by
and as God’s act of self-limitation—but as existing within God’s freedom and
because of it, in absolute dependence on God’s supremacy. We need a way of
saying that God wills our free response and that our response is truly free
just because God wills it.”

This recently published volume contains several essays by Bulgakov devoted to
eschatological and universalist themes. Many believe that this may be the best
introduction to Bulgakov’s theological vision.

Bulgakov’s is the most profound vision of the greater hope that I have read.

– On the other hand, that nature “cannot not convert…to its true end.”

“To those who accept and transmit the vain Greek teachings that there is a
pre-existence of souls and teach that all things were not produced and did not
come into existence out of non-being, that there is an end to the torment or a
restoration again of creation and of human affairs, meaning by such teachings
that the Kingdom of the Heavens is entirely perishable and fleeting, whereas
the Kingdom is eternal and indissoluble as Christ our God Himself taught and
delivered to us, and **as we have ascertained from the entire Old and New
Scripture, that the torment is unending and the Kingdom everlasting to those
who by such teachings both destroy themselves and become agents of eternal
condemnation to others** ,  
Anathema, Anathema, Anathema! [my emphasis].”

Forgive my incessant probing, but I have to ask you about something (related
to created agency) which I’ve had on my mind since reading your book ‘The
Beauty of the Infinite’.

This six-article series on St Isaac the Syrian might be considered as a
systematic mini-presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, concluding in the
eschatological reconciliation of sinful humanity and fallen angels with their
eternal Creator. Please read the series in order. But if are too impatient to
read the entire series, I give you permission to skip to the end: “[The
Triumph of the Kingdom Over
Gehenna](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/23/the-triumph-of-the-kingdom-
over-gehenna/)” and “[The Demonic Void and the Apokatastasis of
Satan](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/30/the-demonic-void-and-the-
apokatastasis-of-satan/).”

Regarding your series on St Isaac, which was englightening, I don’t see where
it shows that the two ideas are separated. You do say that St. Isaac doesn’t
go into God’s method for effecting everyone’s eventual choosing of Him, but
that doesn’t rule out pre-destination.

If I was only allowed to recommend one book on universalism, this is probably
the one I would choose. Talbott writes clearly and well, and he is sharp as a
tack. The book is intended for a primarily evangelical-Protestant audience.
Orthodox and Catholics will be put off by some of his ecclesiological
convictions; but it’s easy enough to bracket them and simply focus on his
biblical, theological, and philosophical arguments. Talbott has a keen eye for
nonsense. He addresses the biblical testimony head-on. Of particular
importance are the chapters are those in which Talbott discusses human freedom
and the nature of justice. The chapter on predestination is particularly
illuminating.

The 5th Ecumenical Council rejected universalism. Dare we think we know better
than the 5th Ecumenical Council? No.

Lastly, let me say in case I don’t get another chance, I have really benefited
from your writing and lectures. Particularly, I really enjoyed your article on
baseball. But, more seriously, I’ve been working through Beauty of the
Infinite and being challenged throughout. So thank you, and I pray you’ll be
afforded the health to continue writing.

A helpful summary of the eschatological views of St Isaac of Nineveh.
Hryniewicz concludes his article with these words: “Today, after the twelve
centuries which have elapsed since the times of Isaac the Syrian, one reads
his texts with deep affection and sincere admiration. His universal hope makes
him one of the greatest guides and teachers, especially in theological
thinking about the world to come.”

Both of these fly in the face of the faith delivered once and for all that
says that a baptized human person has free will now, *AND* will have free will
in the eschaton.

Belt is not a patristic scholar and certainly not an expert on St Maximus (who
is?), but he is a thoughtful reader and theologian. In this article he
reflects on Maximus’s _Ambiguum_ 7 and wonders whether Maximus’ metaphysics
and understanding of God logically leads to universal salvation, even if the
great Church Father never connected the dots.

That it may generate despair and scrupulosity, I’ll give you that. But that it
violates unconditional love? I don’t understand that. If anything, it
generates and exhibits a spirit of humility, love, and forgiveness.

Dear friend,  
I have been enjoying greatly David Bentley Hart’s thinking on this matter. He
is wrestling with this in translating the New Testament, and is coming to some
fascinating conclusions. We spoke of the two words for (eternal) punishment,
with one kolasis-punishment for a time, for correction; and timoria-punishment
of vengeance. Next he noted that there are forty or so passages in the NT
about universal Salvation, and only one meaning eternal punishment. The
strongest adversary is St. Augustine, not working from Greek but Latin, and
his emendations of the language in Romans 5:18 (which in Greek has neither
subject, nor verb, nor object), and I Corinthians 15:22. And, Augustine is
particularly strident in his polemic against Julian, who riled him as no other
did in Augustine’s late age. (Ep. 101, 4). See Augustine’s Contra Jul. 4, and
24.

Too long a question. I think I have been pretty clear in saying that the
conversion in question is necessarily a conversion of the will through its own
free (and progressively freer) act. Even the will’s power to say no, however,
is animated by its primordial hunger for the Good and, as Gregory and others
argue, to that it cannot say no, except by ceasing to exist. That is the act
of all its acts. So, in time, over the ages perhaps, it continues to seek its
rest in God, freely but, for that reason, inevitably.

Second, freedom as defined in a purely voluntarist, spontaneous, atelic
movement of the will–pure libertarian freedom–might be denied by the doctrine
of apokatastasis. But that is a logically incoherent model of freedom in any
event. The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom
is one in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance,
wills the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to
achieve that end without hindrance. Thus God is perfectly free precisely
because he cannot work evil, which is to say nothing can prevent him from
realizing his nature as the infinite Good. Similarly, for Gregory of Nyssa or
Gregory of Nazianzus, perfect freedom is liberation from the fetters of
ignorance that constrain the rational will from seeing the Good as what it is.
For Augustine, the highest freedom is the perfection of human nature in a
condition of “non posse peccare.” For Maximus, the natural will is free
because it tends inexorably towards God, and the gnomic will is free precisely
to the degree that it comes into harmony with the natural will. And so on.
Since, after all, all employments of the will are teleological–necessarily
intentionally directed towards an end, either clearly or obscurely known by
the intellect–and since the Good is the final cause of all movements of the
will, no choice of evil can be free in a meaningful sense. For evil is not an
end, and so can be chosen under the delusion that it is in some sense a good
in respect of the soul (even if, in moral terms, one is aware that one is
choosing what is conventionally regarded as “evil”); and no choice made in
ignorance can be a free choice.

To a large extent, opposition to the greater hope is governed by a failure of
imagina­tion: we cannot _imagine_ how God can save all _if_ human beings are
truly free. The logic of eternal damnation binds our minds. In these homilies
MacDonald liberates our imagination and invites us into a vision of the Father
who loves infinitely and eter­nally. “Nothing is inexorable but love,” he
declares. The Father will never abandon his children.

Hi, everyone. I am temporarily closing the comments on this page. It really is
not intended for extended discussion, but I allowed it to continue because we
often do not get a visitor of the intellectual caliber of David Hart. My
special thanks to David for addressing our many questions.

In this fine piece, Klager articulates a cosmic eschatology grounded in
humanity’s ontological union with the Incarnate Word. He features St Gregory
of Nyssa, but he also draws on the Divine Liturgy and the ascetical tradition
on _theosi_ _s_. He concludes by affirming a universalist hope along the lines
advocated by Ware and Evdokimov.

Oh, and there is no “heresy of apokatastasis.” Unless you know of an
ecumenical council that, unlike the 5th, really proclaimed there is. If you
won’t call it a heresy, I won’t say anything similar of those whose theology
is so clearly a rejection of 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 11, not to mention
all of 1 Timothy.

Gavrilyuk offers a helpful introduction to Bulgakov’s eschatology. He is
ultimately critical of Bulgakov’s universalist convictions: he thinks that the
great theologian slides into a metaphysical necessitarianism, just as Origen
did. I disagree. Bulgakov is too concerned to preserve the synergistic freedom
of the creature to allow any kind of necessity to govern his eschatological
convictions.

Yes, you, John Milbank, William Desmond.  
When I’m in the mood for a little light reading . . .

“But what about Judas? the universalist is always asked. Judas is the test
case of the Savior’s love. Will Christ, can Christ, save his fallen apostle?

Finally! In this affordable volume Ramelli distills her years of research on
apokatastasis in the first- and early second-millennium into an accessible
format. During the first six centuries, the greater hope was alive and well in
many quarters of the Church. Must-buy, must-read.

Jordan Wood, “[The Remarkable Unity of Rhetoric and Dialectic in _That All

In simple terms, if a deranged man chooses to slash himself with a knife or
set fire to himself, you would not be interfering with his “freedom” by
preventing him from doing so. You would be rescuing him from his slavery to
madness. This is why the free-will defense of the idea of an eternal hell is
essentially gibberish.

I wanted to be Captain Kirk too, around 1975. L’hommes d’un certain age.

My wife and I will be moving there in September for her postdoc. I’ve
contacted the local Orthodox parish here in Doha (and the Archbishop in a
chance encounter; he deflected my inquiry) in order to begin conversion to
Orthodoxy, but it has been of no avail. Anyway, my wife and I will be
travelling throughout the region and coordinating our move back to the States
this summer so I will unfortunately not be able to begin the initiation (that
is, if it resembles the duration of RCIA) until we’re settled in Princeton. In
light of Fr. John discouraging universal salvation, I’m hesitant to explain to
an unsympathetic priest that it is largely St. Isaac’s writings on the
atonement and our ultimate reconciliation with God that has drawn me to the
Church. Can you recommend a parish in Princeton where that will not
automatically exclude me from entering the Church?

Transformation in the eschaton necessarily exceeds our imaginative capacities.
I have no doubt synergy is involved. No one will be coerced into beatitude.
Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to me that what you may really be after is a
deeper reflection upon the connection between our temporal becoming and
eternal identity. You won’t be able to shoehorn that into a clear and concise
conceptualization. Poets may elucidate a suggestive image. I suspect art, at
any rate, while it must fail as well, will probably fail less than the
language of concepts.

A very interesting discussion…On reading the posts, some quite technical and
others quite poetic and evocative, I could not help but think of the need for
this type of conversation to be more broad in that such a topic has also been
addressed in other religious traditions. I think, for instance, of the
Buddhist tradition, ( Mahayana), of the Bodhisattvas who refuse entering total
enlightenment until all beings are also saved, enlightened.  
On ignorance and enlightenment, Dogen Zenji is quite adamant that
enlightenment occurs in the midst of ignorance. He upholds a paradoxical way,
one that I find challenging to our usual black/white, binary logic.  
At any rate, I find the discussion to have been, for me, quite fruitful and
encouraging. I hope the participants, all of them, find the goal they are
earnestly striving for.

Faced with the lights of the Kingdom of heaven in the night (in itself
hopeless) of hell, we are therefore empowered by faith to throw ourselves
naked into the love of God. As worthy descendants of Abraham—“In hope he
believed against hope” (Rom 4:18)—we hope that the bottomless depths of God’s
fatherhood, of Christ’s Passion, and of the resources of the Holy Spirit will
allow us to escape from the fiery prison that is hell. We can say nothing of
how this might be; but we must trust absolutely in the reserves of love,
grace, and glory, whose only measure is God’s love for the Son in the Holy
Spirit, a love in which we are forever included. Moreover, since God has
revealed to us in his Son that we are saved and saveable by pure grace, and
never by our works (Rom 1–4), how could it be otherwise when the eschatology
of every creature is decided, at the crowning moment when the mystery of
grace, in which we have been established for all time by God himself, will be
fulfilled? In this light, hell becomes, with regard to a boundless faith, the
location of choice for God’s victory over the most incomprehensible
rejection—victory that could be called humanly unexpected and that is for the
prayer of the spiritual and for the thought of the theologian “able to be
hoped for.”

Some other universalist voices: St. Silouan the Athonite and (according to Fr.
Cyril Hovorun and Balthasar) probably Maximus the Confessor.

But no one denies free will. Everything here is an affirmation of it. It is
the “voluntarist” view of freedom, paradoxically, that would make the will
incapable of freedom. Do you, as a Christian, believe you are free just
because you make choices, or that you are ever freer the better the choices
you make are? Because they correspond to the truth that is God, I mean?
Forgive me, but you simply need to think the matter through with greater
attention to the logic of freedom and the logic of what metaphysical and modal
attributes are entailed in the word “God.” No Church Father ever had a keener
and fuller and more sophisticated understanding of free will than did Gregory
of Nyssa. None was a more adamant and unhesitating universalist. The two
things are not in tension in his thought; they are necessarily logically
implied in one another.

The New Testament only seems to clearly teach eternal damnation if it is read
through a hermeneutic of perdition. Its witness looks very different when read
through the paschal victory of Jesus Christ.

Eric C.: I think that even among those who believe in libertarian free will
(no determinism), many, perhaps most, still believe that God can foreknow what
we will freely do (even if God can’t cause us to do what we do, if we’re to be
free). If you think universalism is revealed in inspired scripture, you
needn’t buy into determinism, but just divine foreknowledge.  
(Actually for me, that doesn’t help, because I’m among the minority who think
God cannot even foreknow, at least with absolute certainty, what we will
freely do. But I still count myself a universalist. I think that so long as
you accept that it’s overwhelmingly probable that all will be saved, you
should count. I also have another scheme by which the salvation of all might
be absolutely certain, but won’t go into that here.)

Now, if God were to say, “My dear Yaakov, no matter what you do or desire,
even against your strongest wish, I will turn your heart to me” – then I’d say
that statement would be more of a turn off than “only you will perish and
there’s nothing I can do to save you”.

Brad, I presume that “holy monk of Mt. Athos” who is quoted is St. Silouan?
Thanks. I needed to read that after reading Fr. John’s posts on this subject.
It is that precise agony of prayer in my own experience, a deep grief that any
should miss Christ and be lost, that I believe prompted the Lord in His mercy
to open my eyes to the Orthodox Church. Without at least a hope that all might
be saved–without a genuinely Orthodox Paschal vision–I don’t see how I would
be able to go on getting up again after I fall down in my walk with Christ. I
live in dread that Fr. John’s interpretation of the Tradition of the Church
might be correct. This fallen world is already more a hell to me than I can
handle–watching cultures coarsen, crash and burn, knowing how people suffer
and being mostly powerless to help any of them. St. Silouan’s vision is the
prayer that keeps me going.

LOL. I’m going to need to get a job before getting this book but it does look
interesting and weighty.

But what is crystal clear is that the will of a baptized person is free, and
that freedom is ontologically a property of the will. And it is also crystal
clear that as our will is sanctified, glorified, deified–whatever term you
want to use–in Glory–and that it nevertheless is in the ontological sense,
*FREE*.

Thomas Allin, D.D., lived at a time when it was not unusual for an Anglican
parish priest to also be an eminent scholar. He also lived at a time when a
growing number of British Protestants were challenging the received doctrine
of everlasting damnation. _Christ Triumphant_ is a classic work of this period
and is noteworthy for its presentation of the patristic witness to the larger
hope, as well as its strong theological case for the greater hope. Highly
recommended.

“The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom is one
in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance, wills
the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to achieve
that end without hindrance. ”

Anyway, let Fr John believe as he believes. I have encountered that sort of
Orthodox or Catholic before. They are often the most vigorous in good works
too (being far nicer, it seems, than the God their theology describes).

Potentially, every source of delusion would be removed or healed when we ‘see
him face to face’ … the telos would be an experience of pure clarity to a
graciously restored mind and will.

Macrina seems rather hopeful, even for the demons [whatever they are]. And
this not without some warrant from Colossians 1, where even that which is
invisible is reconciled by his blood (and what might that be?) … and yet
Hebrews says that Christ came for the help of humans and specifically not
angels. And anyway, by the time we get to the desert fathers, ‘demons’ starts
taking on less of a ‘fallen angels’ backstory and sounds a lot more like what
alcoholics say when they describe ‘wrestling with their demons.’ (Anthony
excepted). So what to make of it?

For a helpful exposition of MacDonald’s views, see Thomas Talbott, “[Universal
Salvation in the Theology of George
MacDonald](http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/George%20MacDonald%20chapter.pdf).”
Regarding MacDonald’s speculations on how God might convert the wicked after
death, see my article “[The Hell of Self and the Redemption of the Outer
Darkness](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/the-hell-of-self-and-the-

I absolutely agree with all you’ve said. I’d love to admire several comments
in particular, but I’ve hogged enough of the convo. So just one quick comment,
on this:

“The moral conscience may accept hell, understood in the sense of a state of
purification of the soul – lasting, perhaps, but not perpetual. But here is
what matters: hell can be vanquished, and it is already vanquished. This is
the central affirmation of our Faith. To believe in Christ is to believe in
His victory over hell. He is the vanquisher of death and of hell. He is our
Deliverer. He alone can liberate us from hell, even now or in the next life.
It should be added that the Orthodox Church disregards the Latin distinction
of hell and purgatory. She prays for all the dead and does not accept that
there are any who are already damned forever. The existence beyond the grave
is nothing but the continuation of the deceased’s destiny, with its
progressive purifying and liberating action – a healing, a maturation and a
creative expectation.”

“When once to a man the human face is the human face divine, and the hand of
his neighbor is the hand of a brother, then will he understand what St. Paul
meant when he said, “I wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren.” But he will no longer understand those who, so far from feeling the
love of their neighbor an essential of their being, expect to be set free from
its law in the world to come. There, at least, for the glory of God, they may
limit its expansive tendencies to the narrow circle of their heaven. On its
battlements of safety, they will regard hell from afar, and say to each other,
“Hark! Listen to their moans. But do not weep, for they are our neighbors no
more.”

If you are looking for a philosophically sophisticated defense of the
universalist hope, this is the book for you. Kronen and Reitan are both
trained philosophers. They are well acquainted with the philosophical
literature on universalism, as well as with the scholastic tradition. They
critically analyze the classical and modern doctrines of hell, present the
arguments they deem most convincing in support of universal salvation, and
respond to various objections. Anyone who wants to argue against universalism
first needs to read _God’s Final Victory_ and address its arguments.

Fr Aidan call tell you how long I’ve complained about the idea that postmortem
salvation proceeds via an overwhelming revelation of truth that effectively
determines our ‘yes’ for God. ;o

The Apostle Peter teaches that after his death, the Lord descended into hades
and preached the good news to the departed. In her hymnody the Eastern Church
sings that the result of this harrowing was the rescue of all.

I thought the same thing about the entirety of “A Voice from the Emerald
World.” Surely you were a fan?

Salvation](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/preaching-good-good-very-
good-news-st-isaac-the-syrian-and-universal-salvation/)”

The question of everlasting damnation does not possess the status of
infallibility because it directly contradicts the revealed truth of divine
love and goodness and the “happy ending” promised by the gospel of Jesus
Christ.

Nemes argues that despite the passages in the New Testament that threaten
eternal damnation, we do not in fact know whether hell will be eternally
populated. Hence we may confidently pray for the salvation of all.

However, it does seem to me that God’s dealings with us (postmortem) cannot
reduce to his simply overwhelming us with truth to the degree that our saying
“no” to God is rendered impossible. So while it’s true that no choice made in
ignorance can be ‘free’ in the fullest sense, it’s also true that the sort of
‘becoming’ that moves us into participation in God can only be made within a
context of the right kind of epistemic distance (i.e., a context in which we
both know enough to choose rightly and are ignorant enough to manufacture a
false narrative in choosing wrongly—that this ‘distance’ defines the synergy
we value). But if epistemic distance is reduced to zero, does not synergy
reduce to determinism? I am inclined to universalism, but I think configuring
the human response to God in a way that guarantees it will be ‘yes’ is
problematic. So I tend just to say that God will pursue us as long as it takes
without positing a _terminus ad quem_.

Dame Julian of Norwich was probably not a universalist, not explicitly so, but
her visions of Christ provide a strong case for the salvation of all. Clearly
the greater hope dwelt deep in her heart. “All shall be well.”

Thanks again for taking the time to clarify. You have said that what you are
arguing is essentially communicated in the works of Gregory of Nyssa, Isaac,
Maximus, and George MacDonald; so it may be that I should read them first and
then return to comment.

William Desmond draws a distinction between the _conatus essendi_ (the
striving, struggle for living) and the _passio essendi_ (the pure giftedness
of our being which is the prior foundation upon which the latter derives.)
Modernity is largely blind to the _passio essendi_ and it would not see it as
freedom. Instead, it identifies freedom with something that is derivative,
secondary, and not really a metaphysically coherent concept of liberty. True
freedom as the perfected flourishing of one’s being is an eschatological
fruition that can be anticipated insofar as one’s actions bring one closer to
the unique gift of one’s being/vocation granted by the creator God.

With reference to C. S. Lewis’s _The Great Divorce_ , I reflect on the
possibility of heavenly happiness when one knows that one or more loved ones
are suffering everlasting torment.

  31. Pingback: [Kimel and Hart on universalism | A Thinking Reed](https://thinkingreed.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/kimel-and-hart-on-universalism/)

In the general eschatological context, how must we consider these wildly
categorical affirmations of St. John Chrysostom concerning the chaining,
humiliation and death of hell – its annihilation? Let us state frankly – the
idea of eternal hell and eternal suffering for some and eternal bliss
(indifferent to suffering) for others, can no longer remain in the living and
renewed Christian conscience as it was formerly presented in our catechisms
and our official theology courses. This archaic conception which claims to be
based on the Gospel texts, understands them in a literal, coarse and material
sense, without penetrating the hidden spiritual meaning of the images and
symbols. This conception is increasingly showing itself to be an intolerable
violation of Christian conscience, thought and faith. We cannot accept that
the sacrifice of Golgotha has revealed itself to be powerless to redeem the
world and conquer hell. Otherwise we should say: creation is a failure, and
Redemption is also a failure. It is high time for all Christians to witness in
common and reveal their mystical experience – intimate in this area – as well
as their spiritual expectations, and perhaps also their revolt and horror
before materialistic, anthropomorphic representations of hell and the Last
Judgment, and of the heavenly Jerusalem. It is high time to be done with all
these monstrosities – doctrinal or not – often blasphemous, from ages past,
which make of our God of Love that which He is not: an ‘external’ God, who is
merely an “allegory of earthly kings and nothing else.” The pedagogy of
intimidation and terror is no longer effective. On the contrary, it blocks
entry into the Church to many who are seeking a God of Love “who loves
mankind” (the “Philanthropos” of the Orthodox liturgy).  
A holy monk of Mount Athos,20 a staretz who was almost our contemporary wrote
the following, addressed to every Christian: “If the Lord saved you along with
the entire multitude of your brethren, and one of the enemies of Christ and
the Church remained in the outer darkness, would you not, along with all the
others, set yourself to imploring the Lord to save this one unrepentant
brother? If you would not beseech Him day and night, then your heart is of
iron – but there is no  
need for iron in paradise.”  
And St. Paul, who was so truly united to Christ that he was able to affirm:
“It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me,” – did he not say
that he was ready to be “separated from Christ for his brothers?”  
Must not each of us plead with the Lord in the same way: May all my brothers
be saved along with me! Or otherwise, may I also be damned along with them!
Does not our Lord also wait for us to pray such a prayer? And would not this
prayer also be the solution to the ‘problem’ of hell and damnation?

Hi, Eric. For my own thoughts about the Fifth Ecumenical Council, see “[The
Heresy That Never Was](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/apocatastasis-
the-heresy-that-never-was/).”

Kronen & Reitan analyze the philosophical case for annihilationism in light of
the arguments advanced in their book. Bottomline: annihilationism suffers from
many of the same flaws as does infernalism.

What are the conditions of rational freedom, and does the choice to reject God
definitively fulfill them?

I must confess, it’s the only one I’ve yet to read. Perhaps I should fear for
my soul.

For my own part, it does not bother me that Fr. John holds the opinions he
does, but rather that he wishes to exalt his personal theologumena to doctrine
to which all Orthodox Christians ought to adhere. He wishes for Orthodoxy to
preach doctrine that, in all honesty, would likely have kept me from ever
converting to the faith.

The radical unconditionality of divine grace is the evangelical heart of the
theological writings of Robert Farrar Capon. So why isn’t he proponent of
universal salvation?

It may be that I simply have not come across universalists of that variety. I
am familiar with patristic universalists, with a variety of mediaeval and
modern figures, I revere George MacDonald especially…but I probably am
entirely unaware of a great deal of popular universalism.

Talbott was asked to write a new essay for the online Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. This article provides a helpful review of recent philosophical
discussion of hell. Talbott does not hide his universalist sympathies. For a
different perspective, see [the article by Jonathan
Kvanvig](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/heaven-hell/) that
Talbott’s piece replaced.

Umm, well, not in earnest, you know. But, in retrospect, it might be my
favorite in the collection.

But here I’ll withdraw from the conversation. I will lay out my reasoning in
the book, if my health allows. God bless everyone (and I do mean everyone).

Jersak surveys the hymns of the Orthodox liturgies and offers this conclusion:
“Our kontakia and troparia, our typika and canons, are a continuous bold
declaration that what Christ accomplished through the Cross, his conquest into
hades and his glorious resurrection, was for all humanity, affects all
humanity and calls all humanity. They comprise the gospel announcement that
Christ is victorious over death and has raised up humanity with himself.”

In short, the realization of metaphysical freedom is not simply the product of
individual choice. Indeed, the person as a center of volition and knowing is
always already not a pure autonomous center of freedom, but a nurtured product
of heteronomy. We come to awareness, desire, knowledge and love because our
existence is gifted, our development nurtured, our very consciousness as
personal called into being by God and world. Without the world, we would not
even acquire the reflectivity that indirectly shows the soul to itself. This
also implies, I think, that a universal making new is consistent with a proper
notion of the person. It is only those who think salvation along the lines of
an atomized individualism that dissent.

Ramelli explores Origen’s and St Gregory Nyssen’s integration of philosophy
and biblical exegesis in their reflections on apokatastasis. If you can’t
afford her mono­graph (who can?), then by all means take a look at this essay.
Ramelli believes that Origen (and by implication Gregory) has been
misunderstood and misrepresented by the ecclesiastical tradition. He certainly
was no Origenist.

I don’t follow. Is belonging to the Church the same thing as being rendered
magically sinless? And who denies that one can suffer spiritual harm? I am
sorry, but your question does not seem to have any relation to the claim being
made ( which, incidentally, is exactly the same claim as Maximus the Confessor
makes about freedom).

My blog has become somewhat “infamous” for its promulgation of the
universalist hope. You may find of interest my series on **[St Isaac the
Syrian](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/st-isaac-the-syrian-the-

Bulgakov](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/sergius-bulgakov-the-

have a chance to glance at them, I’d welcome your feedback.

Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and Maximos the

Hi, Brad. Welcome to Eclectic Orthodoxy. I have your book sitting on my shelf,
but I haven’t read it yet. One of these days … 🙂

You mentioned the toll houses, a curious bit of semi-gnostic bric-a-brac. Fr
John might be interested to know that many monks who embraced that teaching
did so because they were universalists.

Bulgakov was perhaps the most creative, daring, profound—and also most
contro­versial—Orthodox theologian of the 20th century. Those of us who are
unacquainted with Russian philosophy, as I am, will probably find this a
difficult book to read; yet it is illuminating in ways that most works of
theology are not. Bulgakov’s mind and heart were alive with the Holy Spirit.
He was a true priest and theologian of the Church.

OK with all that said…. Which authors or theologians in your reading have you
come across that would agree or created this thought? Thank you so much for
your help!

Andreano identifies the misconceptions many people have about what
universalists believe and answers the common objections advanced against the
greater hope.

This may be the first book I would recommend to someone who desires to explore
the biblical basis for the universalist hope. Written for a popular audience,
Jersak invites his readers to bracket their dogmatic systems and listen to the
Scriptures afresh, in all of their irreducible diversity and complexity. “Our
obsessive attempts,” he writes, “to harmonize the Scriptures into artificially
coherent, stackable propositions—as if they required us to contend for their
reliability or authority—actually do violence to their richness.” One finds
within the Bible specific texts that may be reasonably interpreted to support
each of the three major construals of eschatological destiny—infernalist,
annihilationist, and universalist. Perhaps we need to hear all three voices.

I’m sure Ilaria Ramelli’s recent tome “The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis” will become an essential standard.

I am not really wrestling with the text, at least not in a moral or
intellectual or existential sense. My only struggles are finding the _mot
juste_ (so to speak). I am, and have never concealed that I am, a complete and
unreserved universalist, and believe no other interpretation of Paul’s
theology is coherent. Geoffrey Wainwright’s review of my first book noted it,
for instance. Gregory of Nyssa, after all, succeeded where Augustine failed:
his eschatology incorporates the whole of the New Testament witness (sans
Revelation, which he did not regard as canonical) in a seamless synthesis,
without truncation, equivocation, or attempts to explain away the plain
meaning of crucial texts.

Silouan did Not dogmatically assert apokatastasis. He certainly held to more
than a mere hope. Sophrony too. This is not something they hid. Merely read
them.

_____, “[Anselmian Apokatastasis: The Fitting Necessity of Universal Salvation
in St Anselms _Cur Deus
Homo_](https://www.academia.edu/38365832/Anselmian_Apocatastasis_The_Fitting_Necessity_of_Universal_Salvation_in_St_Anselms_Cur_Deus_Homo)”

Seriously, though, when Brian writes: “I maintain that the original gift of
being involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some
level, but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream,
play, wonder, creativity and loving encounter,” it is rather as if I am
reading someone else laying out my own sensibility. But I think there is a
deep theological insight here that is too easily ignored as something vague,
gauzy, or sentimental, because we are all so prone to thinking in the rather
arid categories of (for want of a better word) analytic correspondence that we
regard the entire tacit dimension of knowledge (which is the foundation of all
knowledge) as somehow either merely inchoate or merely emotional. If one is
not careful, one ends up with the barren dialectic of “rationalism” or
“fideism,” and one ends up like a certain popular Thomist I know of, unable to
think in any other terms than that.

I guess my question is – if this is true, then why do communicating members of
the Church fall into greivous sin and error? Further, how does this relate to
the pre and post communion prayers which suggest that the effect of God’s
presence can be damaging to those who are unprepared or unrepentant?

I still question the logic of a teleological approach leading inescapably to
universalism. Why is it not possible that some persons will never come to
regard God as their final Good and, thus, never freely choose Him? I agree
that true freedom is found in the true worship and service of God, but I do
not understand why some could not remain forever in the delusion that
something (or more likely someone?) other than God is their final Good. Am I
missing an element in the argument?

Well, had a look. Not terrifically compelling, however angry. But this Fr John
fellow seems rather unaware of the full Greek and Syriac traditions of reading
the cardinal texts. Someone send him the last chapter of Solomon’s Book of the
Bee. (yes, a Chaldean, but with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Syrian
fathers.) Or Ilaria Ramelli’s latest book, which–for all its flaws–is full of
good citations and references. Or send him to fathers like Gregory of Nyssa or
Isaac of Ninevah, who fully reveal how they understand such terms as “αιωνιος”
or “le-alma” in the course of their expositions. Fr Aidan says Fr John is a
good man. Perhaps. But peremptory certitude allied with broad ignorance is not
piety, but mere fanaticism; and, whatever his personal virtues, this Fr John
fellow simply exhibits neither much scholarly range nor much theological
depth. The thing to recall is that, outside the Seven Councils, the licit
range of theological opinion is far larger than these self-appointed rigorists
know. They do not get to say whether, for instance, Evdokimov, or Olivier
Clement, or Bulgakov (etc.) are less truly Orthodox than they. (Or, to cite
the more moderate, “hopeful” universalists, Alfeyev or Ware.) They believe
their Orthodoxy IS Orthodoxy ( though inevitably they seem to cling to clearly
extra-canonical superstitions like the doctrine of the Tollhouses or bizarre
late 19th century Greek figures like Makrakis, and so on). They also seem to
think the Synodikon and the opinions of certain bishops have an authority that
they clearly do not. Even holy bishops (saints are frequently bad thinkers).
It would be so much easier for them if Orthodoxy had a pope, I suppose, and a
magisterium, and some organ for declaring opinions heresy even on matters not
determined by the ecumenical councils. Alas, it is not so. And, unless another
council is convoked, I fear that merely reciting the opinions (which is all
they are) of certain “holy men” or “holy texts” (rather than others) is not
the same thing as making a good argument. (Oh, but I’ll play along: the
doctrine of the Tollhouses is a crypto-gnostic heresy and those who hold to it
are not TRULY TRULY Orthodox. I make this pronouncement entirely upon the
basis of my own personal predilections and my own unauthorized but very deeply
felt sense of what I have decided to believe is TRUE Orthodoxy, drawn from
sources I have endued with ultimate authority.)

To our list of Orthodox universalist authors, I would like to add Fr.
Alexandre Turnicev, who wrote Alexandre Turincev (1966) “Une approche de
l’eschatologie orthodoxe,” Contacts 18, no. 54. The article also appeared in
part in Olivier Clément, ‘Dieu est Vivant: catéchisme pour les familles par
une équipe de Chrétiens Orthodoxes’ (Editions du Cerf, 1979), which was the
original French edition of ‘The Living God: A Catechism for the Christian
Faith’, 2 Vols. Trans. by Olga  
Dunlop (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1988) but that chapter was omitted in
the English  
translation. So Father Michael Gillis and the monks from Holy Transfiguration
Hermitage (Gibsons, BC Canada) helped me translate it into English. You can
see it in the Canadian Journal of Orthodox Christianity here:
<http://www.cjoc.ca/pdf/Vol_9_1_1_Eschatology.pdf>

I might say here that even hopeful inclusivists so far unable to dogmatize
this universal hope are nevertheless obligated by love to hope and pray for
it, to the degree that the supposed alternatives (infernalism, conditional
immortality or annihilationism) are in principle untenable.

Ludlow examines the eschatological convictions of St Gregory Nyssen in detail.
“Whoever considers the divine power,” Gregory writes, “will plainly perceive
that it is able at length to restore by means of the _aionion_ purging and
atoning sufferings, those who have gone even to this extremity of wickedness.”
Hell is purgation that culmi­nates in salvation. Gregory’s views on the
apocatastasis were not condemned by the Church at the 5th Ecumenical Council
and would later profoundly influence the eschatological reflection of Sergius
Bulgakov.

Like you, St. Isaac had a huge influence on me, hence my baptismal name.
Nobody here will turn you away for that. It is a great, thoughtful and
welcoming community that will be happy to have you.

Section III of _Bride of the Lamb_ is devoted to the topic of eschatology.
This section can be read to great benefit just by itself. Bulgakov’s
universalism is neither sentimental nor trite. He does not envision salvation
apart from repentance and ascetical sacrifice. We should fear hell and its
torment, but we should trust God more. “The torments of hell are a longing for
God caused by the love of God,” he states. It is blasphemy to think that evil
will triumph over the the risen Lord. Bulgakov emphatically rejects any
violation of the human person. No one can or should be coerced into the
kingdom. The divine judgment is nothing less than the full revelation of the
Christ, in whose image every human being is made: “Every human being sees
himself in Christ and measures the extent of his difference from this proto-
image. A human being cannot fail to love the Christ who is revealed in him,
and he cannot fail to love himself revealed in Christ.” (See Roberto de la
Noval’s article on Bulgakov, listed below.)

I hope that you, Fr. Kimel, and the many other universalists and hopeful
universalists out there continue to engage in the conversation.

Not that I would care if it did. That very imperial “ecumenical ” council is
an embarrassment in Christian history, and I sometimes think it a mercy that
such a hash was made of its promulgation that we literally do not know what
was truly determined there. For my money, if Origen was not a saint and church
father, then no one has any claim to those titles. And the contrary claims
made by a brutish imbecile Emperor are of no consequence.

This article is one of a series on the eschatology of Sergius Bulgakov. He
contends that in the final judgment, all will see the risen Christ and in
their hearts will know the One in whose image they were made and know, by
comparison, how far they have fallen from the Image. “It is impossible,”
declares Bulgakov, to appear before Christ and to see Him without loving him.”

I am truly gratified you think well of my writing. Certainly, I would welcome
a venue to share my thoughts.

Written a decade after his _Theandros_ essay, and taking into account more
recent scholarship, Andreapoulos elaborates on the eschatological perspectives
of St Maximus. As in his earlier essay, he believes that the logic of
Maximus’s ontological and anthropological reflections leave open the
possibility of universal salvation. Regarding apokatastasis Andreapoulos
concludes:

As long as the subject of Dr Hart’s fiction has come up, I’d like to express
how truly outstanding that collection is.

Paul Blowers has advanced a similar judgment in his recently published book
[_Maximus the
Confessor_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199673942/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99673942&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId=ESWZTPE3NAGUMVMY).

Yaakov, I cannot imagine myself commending to parishioners, either in a homily
or by way of spiritual counsel, that they adopt St Antony’s prayer “All will
be saved except I.” Perhaps certain ascetics can **safely** adopt such a
prayer, but I do not think that most ordinary believers can. It seems to
violate the gospel-word of unconditional love and would too easily generate
despair and scrupulosity.

Drawing on Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance, Paschall proposes that universal
salvation appropriately follows from God’s election of humanity in Jesus
Christ.

On reflection, I think the first. However, I think that the first statement is
kind of a given, even in St. Anthony’s statement. It’s not that God will not
find a way to turn our heart to him, but that we don’t accept his invitation.

_I will update this list as I continue to read on this subject._

David, may I ask for your thoughts about the dogmatic authority with Orthodoxy
of the [Synodikon](https://sites.google.com/site/thetaboriclight/synodikon).
It is sometimes invoked as a decisive authority against the universalist hope.
This anathema in particular is cited:

Which, incidentally, does not break from the “synergist” view. It is merely to
say that the cooperation of the created will with God’s is still a
cooperation–if needs be by terrible purgation–in restoring a human soul to its
natural state. I think of Gregory of Nyssa deals with this quite delightfully
and cogently in De anima et resurrectione.

Nemes critically analyzes two classical objections against the universalist
hope, one from the Augustianian-Reformed tradition and the other from the
Arminian-Wesleyan tradition: (1) The divine goodness does not require that God
save anyone. (2) If human beings are genuinely free, then they must be able to
eternally and irrevocably reject God and thus separate themselves from his
love and mercy.

I think I’m tracking with you … so might we say that the showing and seeing is
what heals (rather than coerces) the gnomic will such that neither God’s self-
revelation nor our natural response (of both nous in seeing and will in
following) can be charged with voluntarism?

What that has to do with universalism is that, if it as persons that we are
saved, having achieved personhood through communion, rather than as abstract
essences, then the notion of an eternal hell becomes not only a problem for,
but an absolute barrier to, a coherent concept of salvation. But my dog needs
to be walked, so I can’t explain that now.

This is a classic in Roman Catholic literature on the subject. Here we see the
decisive break in post-Vatican II Catholicism from retributivist models of
both purgatory and hell.

This book contains most, though not all, of my articles (now revised) on
universal salvation. Enjoy!

Brad J: As it happens, I ordered your book from amazon just yesterday. Looking
forward to getting it and reading it. I enjoyed a blog post of yours from some
time ago about (among other things) the two Gregorys.

I think the most important phrase of those anathemas is from 1. “which follows
from it,” identifying, as DBH has said earlier, the problem is only a
particular version of apokatastasis that ‘follows from’ the broader (and
immediate) problematic worldview — one which Gregory of Nyssa had explicitly
repudiated, thereby not only allowing for his own version, but also
rehabilitating Origen’s? (well in advance of the 5th council).

I am recommending this book for its chapter on St Isaac’s eschatology. More
than a few Orthodox priests have whispered to me: “I am a universalist at
heart, but I can’t tell anyone. St Isaac convinced me.” Why the power of St
Isaac’s writings? Because he _knew_ the power and unconditionality of God’s
love–hence his confidence that God will eventually win over the heart and mind
of every human being and every demon.

Fear not. Fr John is wrong–absolutely and lamentably wrong. God actually is
better than we, not the contemptible tyrant of the servile religious
imagination. Read Isaac. Read George MacDonald’s Unspoken Sermons, the finest
works of theology in the English language.

Personhood is not simply a given, but a task. At minimum, we should recognize
that the relational dimension of the person is just as constitutive of
identity as what one might think of as a “substantial core.” Or, if I can cite
Desmond once more, there is a porosity to personal being both in terms of the
deep structure of the soul and our natural openness to the exterior other. We
are “wholes” in our irreplaceable singularity that paradoxically realize our
integrity through dyanamic, dramatic interaction with the Other (an
interaction with the infinite capacity for novelty — the eternal is not
synonymous with closure or some kind of totalizing completion.)

As for how the fall occurred, no theologian has ever given a satisfactory
theory. But that word “perfect” is misplaced. By definition, nothing temporal
is “perfect” in its origin (unless by origin one means the divine intention
for that being).

To definitively reject God is to choose the nothingness of evil. Some thoughts
on the free-will defense of hell, with special reference to Jonathan Kvanvig
and Eleonore Stump.

Are you sure that you’re not my secret Doppelgaenger, and that soon I’m going

Guinness-induced delirium)? I’m pleased you had the wisdom to avoid the
academic world once you got doctored, but I would like to know what you do,
where you are, and whether you write anywhere. And, if not, there’s a journal
I’m associated with…

Yes, I own it, and I agree–it should be on the list. I’ll add it. Thanks.

This is an important essay (also included in revised form in _That All Shall
Be Saved_ ). Hart discusses the question of eternal damnation and theodicy and
comes down firmly in favor of the universalist vision of St Gregory of Nyssa.
Hart boldly declares that the Christian confession that God is absolute Love
and Goodness, when combined with the equally Christian confession that God has
freely created the world from nothing­ness, excludes the traditional expousal
of the eternal damnation of the wicked. If God is truly good, then he would
never accept the risk that even one of his beloved would be eternally lost.
Humanity has been made by God for God: “To see the good truly is to desire it
insatiably; not to desire it is not to have known it, and so never to have
been free to choose it.”

Since its publication in 1899, this book has been the standard historical work
on the universalist sympathies of the Church Fathers. Its scholarship is
dated—it should be read alongside Ramelli’s _The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis_ —but it remains a useful resource. An online version can be
found at [Tentmaker.org](https://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html).

Following Louth’s lead, it seems like early Maximos assigns a gnomic will to
Christ (since, if we have one, Christ must have a gnomic will, lest what is
not assumed is not healed) and then later, denies it (because he sees it as a
dysfunction). But in positing the gnomic will as a ‘third moment,’ you not
only take the conversation a good leap forward, but also open up our
imaginations to revisit Gethsemane, where ‘Not my will, but thine,’ reveals
that third moment in Christ. Non? Oui?

That is obscure. Sorry. But, yes, I prefer to think that, healed, it remains,
and that it makes each soul’s reflection of and participation in divine beauty
a unique inflection or modulation of the whole. Which makes each individual
indispensable, of course, to that glory.

There is no verse in the New Testament that unambiguously threatens eternal
punishment. There are three that are regularly invoked by the Hellfire Club
(my fond name for those who have some emotional commitment to the idea of a
hell of eternal torment), but none of them really says what they imagine it
says. Conversely, the seemingly very clear statements of universal salvation
number quite high (47 at my last casual count).

I don’t dispute our groundedness in God, nor the undeniable primordial God-
given desire that animates the will (as David’s described), the act of every
act, nor that the end of whatever sort of agency/action it is by which means
we resolve ourselves shall finally end in a perfect and irrevocable harmony
with God.

If man was created perfect and free in this way, why did the Fall occur then?
If man (freely and) necessarily chooses good in prelapsarian state, how is the
Fall even possible?

DeRose asks the free-will defenders of hell: if God cannot save all, why at
least does he not save more than he does? DeRose distinguishes himself from
David Hart in that he cannot affirm that all, without exception, will
indubitably be saved; but he thinks it very, very, very likely.

Oh, I forgot, he quotes a bad translation of Gregory’s De infantibus too. Fr
John, read the Greek, in the Gregorii Nysseni Opera of Jaeger et al. On Cyril
and Athanasius, the arguments of various scholars on ther “disposition” is a
subtle but fascinating one, and Ramelli is actually quite good on that.

Hi, everyone. I’m stepping in here and asking everyone to return to the theme
of the page–the hope of universal salvation. Thank you.

What to do? Can we bring your two phrases together in supposing that it is the
very power to interrupt which must embrace God as its end? God saves ‘that’
power, i.e., our will in its God-given power to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. And it
rests when, as a God-given power to interrupt itself, it gives itself to God.
Maybe that’s your position. Sorry if I’ve misunderstood. But that does look
minimally libertarian to me (not a crude claim to a power to self-determine
free from all context and natural constraints).

Thank you, David. I first became interested in this view from reading
Archbishop Michael Ramsey’s “F. D. Maurice and the Conflicts of Modern
Theology”, (CUP, 1951) which explored the reasons for Maurice being expelled
from King’s College, London, for “unsound views and teachings about the
doctrine of eternal punishment”. In his Theological Essays, Maurice discussed
the use of “aionios” meaning eternal or everlasting, and outside “time”. Barth
writes at length about this- is there anything he doesn’t write at length?
maybe the Kennedy assassination- and Aidan’s note of von Balthasar’s, “Dare We
Hope All Men Be Saved” I found deeply impressive. T  
he last time I saw Ramsey in 1986, he was reading this and “The Glory of the
Lord”, vol. something.

I should have some coffee. Ss Macrina, Gregory Nyssen, Gregory Nazianzen, and
Isaac Syrus pray for us all. St George MacDonald of Aberdeenshire too.

The eschatology of the Orthodox Church is notably underdetermined, in contrast
to that of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result diverse understandings exist
within her precincts. Turincev’s essay represents an excellent introduction to
the eschatology developed by the “Parisian school” of Orthodoxy in the 20th
century, as expressed in this quotation:

Simply said, if it isn’t one of the promulgations of the seven councils, then
it’s nothing but the record of how certain clergymen at a certain time and
place understood the tradition (usually over against those blasted monks). And
then there is the question of what certain councils–the 5th of course–really
said.

especially helpful.

That said, it also seems to me that in light of this, ‘will’ may not be the
locus of salvation in the first place, but rather the ‘nous.’ Briefly, worries
about coercion (the will of God imposed) or ‘free’ vs. ‘bondage’ of the human
will are all still fixated on the primacy of the will in salvation (whether
God’s or our own). However, what I in Scripture is that the divine Nous both
creates and enlightens the God-given human ‘nous’ (the eyes of the heart/mind,
poorly translated ‘intellect’) in order to ‘see the light of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ’ (2 Cor. 4) … something we cannot see as long as
we’re blinded by the god of this age. For whatever reason, some see in this
age and some do not (where ‘see’ is also a metaphor for love). Paul says that
apart from this ‘seeing,’ we cannot respond. And yet if we do ‘see,’ we are
capacitated for an uncoerced response.

Bringing together Origen, St Gregory Nyssen, and George MacDonald, Ross argues
that universal salvation “entails a concept of judgment just as exacting, just
as rigorous, and every bit as righteous as the sort of purely punitive
punishment on offer in any version of the doctrine of eternal damnation.”

A fine article that Jersak wrote for Eclectic Orthodoxy. He maintains that the
universalist hope remains a legitimate option within the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Do not let others tell you otherwise.

The question is based on an ontological confusion, and a naive
anthropomorphism. Sorry to sound arch, but you are not thinking of God as God.
Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot
simply turn away towards “something else.” He is the ground and end of all
desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not
choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire
anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good
and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual
appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee
God, you are desiring God as the “good end” you seek in godlessness. He is
inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are
God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but
an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural
will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don’t think of God as a candidate in
a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the
original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages,
since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will
is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an
object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.

Thank you for bringing my attention to this book. I’m going to have to borrow
it through ILL.

Patristic Universalism: An Alternative to the Traditional View of Divine
Judgment by David Burnfield

The Synodikon is just a compendium, and at times a converses, and possesses
only as much authority as what it is quoting at any point. In itself it is no
more binding on the conscience of an Orthodox than the Baltimore Catechism or
a Thomist manual is on the conscience of a Catholic.

But let’s not pursue the issue. Be wrong in good conscience, and by that you
shall be saved.

Man was not created perfect. Man was created innocent and according to
Gregory, I think, as moral toddlers. This makes the fall inevitable and
therefore, mercy is ultimately God’s only just response. (riffing off Dr
Andrew Klager, an Orthodox universalist). Perfection is the telos of theosis
rather than the first state.

This is a long-ranging article in which I respond to a piece by the Catholic
theologian and Balthasar expert Dr Larry Chapp. Following Balthasar, Chapp
confesses a hopeful, but non-necessary, universalism: God may save all, we
should pray that he will save all, but in the end he may not. What is this
“may not” but an admission that God may turn out not to be as good as we hoped
he would be?

First, note that what is being rejected in those two anathemas is not
universalism. The first rejects pre-existence of souls without bodies, in a
primal and undifferentiated community of monads. The second rejects an
ultimate disappearance both of bodies and of individual identity in a unity
rather of the sort asserted by bar Sudhaili, where gnosis (the single shared
knowledge of God and souls) is indistinguishable from the hypostasis (the
substance) of souls. Neither was a teaching of Origen’s, actually (Origen
taught pre-existence, but not actual bodilessness).

I don’t know if this analogy will help, but I think modern, voluntarist
notions of freedom are akin to the way scientism approaches the existence of
reality. Scientism never really asks the question of why there is something
rather than nothing. It can’t understand that an infinite series of finite
causes still can’t address origins — or even feel the need for such,
apparently. Similarly, voluntarism is fixated on finite, concrete situations
and never sees that the source of freedom is prior and other.

I review the argument of Kronen and Reitan that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if the lost suffer everlastingly.

I wouldn’t suggest that the more ignorant we are the more free we are.
Epistemic distance is qualified on both ends. It can’t be maximized, for then
we would be absolutely ignorant and incapable of choosing God. We have to be
sufficiently informed, obviously. But can the distance be reduced to zero, in
which case we would be so informed, so overwhelmed by the truth, that no
possible means of constructing a ‘no’ to God would be possible?

You know, I’ve tried to talk about all this before and I never feel I quite
communicate what I hope to — or perhaps I am simply not as persuasive as I
would like to be. Here’s another attempt.

Have you read “Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives”? In it, Elder Thaddeus
presents an image of heaven/hell that I don’t think fits into the “River of
Fire” or Divine Retribution categories.

In his great work _The City of God_ , St Augustine identifies seven
universalist and semi-universalist positions that were prevalent in his day
(early 400s). Though he disagreed with all of them, he only judged one of them
as heretical—specifically, the assertion that Satan and the demons will be
saved. Note: he did not consider the claim that all humanity will be saved as
heretical.

Balthasar did not convert me to the universalist hope. The seeds for that hope
were planted back in the early 80s when Thomas Torrance and Robert Jenson
taught me the unconditionality of the divine love. But Balthasar watered those
seeds. Faith in the absolute love of God slowly began to grow into hope for a
universalist Future. Eventually, though, I realized that I needed to proclaim
a more confident, greater hope than Balthasar allows.

In replying above to my inquiry about human agency (framed in terms of the
concerns at play between determinists and indeterminists/libertarians), you
replied:

1) Do you think it is possible for a human person to either accept or refuse
God’s gift of salvation in Christ?

This discussion should go down in the annals of the blogosphere as the most
intellectually complex discussion ever to be pursued in the commentary section
of a blog. Thank you all very much!  
Unfortunately, I don’t have sufficient knowledge to participate in the
discussion. That is, I am too ignorant or, as most of you would probably put
it, I am too much lacking freedom.  
But perhaps that’s just because I’m catholic…

A different kind of devil altogether. If you like “The House of Apollo,”
incidentally, by that alone you can gain entrance to paradise–without even
having to go through the Tollhouses.

This is entirely the wrong place to do it, but since I don’t know when I’ll be
within shouting distance of Dr. Hart again, I want to say that the moment in
“The Devil and Pierre Gernet” when Pierre’s soul is taken to heaven and the
demon bewails the “gross liberality of interpretation” with which God judges
man… well, that whole passage deserves to rank among the best universalist
texts of the last thousand years or so.

“St. Paul would be wretched before the throne of God, if he thought there was
one man beyond the pale of His mercy, and that as much for God’s glory as for
the man’s sake. And what shall we say of the man Christ Jesus? Who, that loves
his brother, would not, upheld by the love of Christ, and with a dim hope that
in the far-off time there might be some help for him, arise from the company
of the blessed, and walk down into the dismal regions of despair, to sit with
the last, the only unredeemed, the Judas of his race, and be himself more
blessed in the pains of hell, than in the glories of heaven?

(and then you could go into Revelation with the gates in the Holy City as
being open and not gated… but it could be argued that that was a
representation of the current realities of those that belong to the Kingdom
and the holy city is a representation of the Christian faith at the time when
John the Revelator wrote the book on the island.)

The benefit of this view is that it still agrees with Jesus’ saying of, “No
one comes to the Father except through me” and allows for a Christian world
view when it comes to the potential of universalism. It’s not that all faiths
and religions lead to the same God, but that they could bring up different
aspects of Christianity that when Christ does return, they could recognize the
Jesus was the one all along, and the Holy Spirit has been wooing them all
along, and the Creator Covenant God does desire to be in relationship with us
all.

Is the “freedom” to sell yourself into slavery or lock yourself in a cage
actual freedom? It seems more like a limitation of the will to me.

Desmond is a friend of mine, incidentally, and I do not know if I have ever
found cause to disagree with him on anything.

‘Divine’ agency can’t be reduced to the traditional terms (determinism,
libertarianism, etc.), but do we need to (indeed, can we?) step altogether
outside these categories to imagine ‘human’ transformation or to agree both
that we possess a God-given power to “interrupt” (to say ‘no’ to) our movement
toward God and that we are “determined” for God as our final end (i.e., cannot
conceivably rest finally in any other end)? I’m curious to know if part of the
answer lies in your “however gradually.” If we’re abandoning the categories of
determinism and libertarianism as a valid way to conceive of the will’s role
in human transformation, why should it take God any time at all to effect the
desired end? It would seem, if we suppose the transformation occurs “however
gradually,” that we’re assuming humans retain (even in our state of final
judgment) something of their power to interrupt the natural movement Godward.

You may be right, Marc. I am agnostic when it comes to the demonic powers, as
it seems to me that all of our speculation about them is precisely
that–speculation. We do know anything about their nature and existence. All we
know is their enmity toward God and toward us. Satan is our enemy. Hence I am
content to remain agnostic. Perhaps they are beyond repentance and thus beyond
salvation.

I’ll presume to suggest my own work, ‘Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hope, Hell
and the New Jerusalem,’ (Wipf and Stock, 2009), which offers a chapter on
Jesus in the Jeremiah tradition, where he consciously quotes or alludes to
every chapter of Jeremiah where ‘the Valley of Hinnom’ is mentioned (and is
symbolic of the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon – i.e. literal destruction) …
surely this plays into Jesus’ use of gehenna in conjunction with the
forthcoming siege in 70. (in part).

Saint Silouan was famous for saying, “all will be saved, and I alone will
perish”. That is not Universalism, it’s humility.

I confess I do press hard, but only to see how much is discoverable; to test-
drive theories. But I’d be happy with the mere affirmation THAT our actions
contribute (in ways that do not reduce to mere secondary causation). If that’s
affirmed, I can tolerate any amount of mystery.

A courageous essay by a Polish Catholic theologian. Hryniewicz directly
challenges centuries of the pedagogy of fear. The section “Is God Helpless in
the Face of the Gift of Freedom?” is particularly illuminating. “God himself
is the greatest hope for all His creatures,” Hryniewicz writes. “He penetrates
even the infernal depths of the human heart. He can lead out of the depths of
Gehenna. He does not destroy the freedom of rational beings, but respects
human choice. However, he has his truly divine way of persuading the freedom
of the beings most in revolt. He attracts and transforms them from the inside
through His goodness, beauty and boundless love manifested above all in the
voluntary kenosis of Christ.”

– On the one hand, “rational nature is capable of interrupting itself” of
preventing its movement toward its natural end in God.

Also, let me confess that I am not well-read in universalism, so my responses
can’t be entirely fair to y’all as I’m not working from a lot of the common
source material. That being said, I find this conversation very interesting
and will continue to read up on the question.

But I don’t want to be understood as suggesting that epistemic distance in
hell is just this world’s context reconstructed in which we comfortably
continue to pursue our careers. I think if we take the sufferings of hell to
be commensurate with “will’s” depth of solidification in evil and our coming
to terms with this, then we don’t have to affirm UR at the expense of free
agency. That is, if the ‘will’ has a share (by either persisting in its ‘no’
and thus suffering OR embracing the truth of its history with a ‘yes’) in the
uncovering of the truth about God and ourselves that steadily renders our
saying ‘no’ to God finally impossible, then I’m OK with that. That is, hell
confronts us, truth by truth, with our whole history which we are free to
accept or reject. And the death of every false self will be unspeakable
torment as we are left to experience the truth of our choices. Ouch. But as we
choose to embrace the truth, we become more free. Eventually we are wholly and
completely God’s. And the journey from one to the other will be the journey
from experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as torment to
experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as beatitude. The
difference between heaven and hell isn’t geography, it’s perspective. The
truth that once tormented us becomes the truth that glorifies us.

It is often not noticed that a significant doctrinal correction has occurred
in Christian theology. For 1500 years hell has been thought as everlasting
retributive punishment. This is no longer the case. Over the past 75 years
Western philosophers and theologians have rejected the punitive model of hell
and have proposed what is a free-will model. Quite independently, Orthodox
theologians have advanced the “river of fire” model. Universal salvation is
but the logical conclusion of the free-will and river of fire models. God is
love, and he will not be satisfied until all have been converted to him in
love.

The question was a bit long, but thank you David for clarifying! Excellent.

The traditional view says no. Death finalizes the sinner’s orientation to God.
But why believe this is so? All explanations seem fatuous and unconvincing.
They presuppose the doctrine of everlasting damnation. In this piece I
summarize the view of the great Sergius Bulgakov. Bulgakov dismisses the
school opinion that death freezes the human person: “the disincarnation in
death does not suppress the activity of the spirit.” The afterlife presents
new possibilities!

Oh, so kind. Again, health is the issue. I began a collection of 25
“parables,,” the first of which appeared as a Back Page column called The True
Helen. I hope to return to that book when I feel well enough. And the. There
is a good deal more fiction I want to write. That was originally what I
planned to do with my life.

I am far more conscious of the many people who have apostasized of any form of
traditional Christian faith or who despair of God’s help because of the
unnuanced preaching of everlasting damnation coupled with the awareness, in
this age of mass media, of all the evil and suffering perpetrated in the world
(a lot of it these days in the name of superior fidelity to the supreme
“God”!) than I do any Christians who do not take the working out of their
salvation seriously because of a cavalier universalist hope in the scope of
Christ’s defeat of the powers of hell. I am blessedly reminded by St.
Silouan’s words here of Christ’s parable of the Lost Sheep, how for the sake
of the one lost, the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 in the fold to go seeking the
one that remains lost. . . . This alone gives hope to my breaking heart. It is
only when I dare to hope that the Lord might really be this relentless and
victorious in His love, that I feel sin begin to loosen its grip on me.

Daniel, have you considered the possibility that you are confusing creaturely
causality and divine causality? As I have expressed in a couple of my past
postings, popular understandings of synergism appear to put God in the same
metaphysical level (just as so many analytic philosophers do today). Hence
they present human freedom and divine action as mutually competitive. But this
simply cannot be the right way to think about the relationship between the
Transcendence and human beings. Take a look at these past articles of mine:

That the natural will has only one transcendental end is logically necessary.
That is not even debatable because it is written In the very definition of the
will as intentional. Please understand that this is different from saying that
the finite deliberative will or finite mind always wills the truly good as the
Good. You are confusing issues.

I agree with the effects of seeing God ‘face to face.’ I question, though,
whether all will ever come to such a state. Is it possible to see God ‘face to
face’ if great delusions remain?

It seems the heresy of apokatastasis presented here isn’t really molesting
Orthodox eschatology or soteriology as much as it cuts asunder the dogma of
Orthodox anthropology that says that baptized human persons have free will.

This is powerfully imaged in the play, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.”
Spoiler alert: The version I saw ends with Judas condemned to hell, Christ
pleading with him even as Judas fades into a catatonic state, and Christ
remains with him. The lights dim as Jesus washes his feet.

This, in a nutshell, is the reason it is hard for me NOT to be a universalist.
How could true freedom result in anything but one’s salvation? The alternative
would be a god who allows certain beings to remain damned by their ignorance.

Standing under the judgment of the Cross (and bound by Catholic dogma), we may
not assert apokatastasis, says Balthasar; but we may—and indeed must—pray for
the salvation of all. Universal restoration in Christ is a possibility for
which we may hope, but can never be a certainty we may proclaim.

David, I had heard from Addison that you have been quite ill. May the Lord
grant you a speedy recovery–and if not a _speedy_ recovery, then at least a
_full_ recovery.

The gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a message of
triumph and unconquerable hope: God will reconcile all sinners to himself in
the eschatological transfiguration of the cosmos. This hope therefore
authorizes preachers to proclaim the gospel in the performative mode of
unconditional promise. This paper was delivered at a conference in Cardiff,
Wales in 2014 and subsequently [published in the journal _Logos_
(2017)](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/preaching-
apokatastasis.pdf).

This is my multi-article commentary on David Hart’s _That All Shall Be Saved_.
My hope is that others will find it helpful in grasping David’s key arguments.
Together these articles present what I believe is a compelling argument that
God will restore all sinners to himself in his Kingdom.

P.S. What are the chances that you will be coming to Princeton in the next two
years?

Right. There’s no value in ignorance per se. I’m only suggesting that the
‘becoming’ of human beings toward their final telos in God be characterized by
choosing which is a choice between alternatives, and not a single inevitable
choice given to them by God (which, I confess, is how I read some construals
of universalism). Does that help at all?

In modern times some Orthodox have begun to claim that all local synods and
councils are doctrinal authoritative and so Orthodoxy has just as many exact
doctrinal formulae as Rome. Call it magisterium-envy. But in fact the ancient
canonical view is that only an ecumenical council can ratify a synod as
doctrinally binding. And it’s been a while, you know.

God can guarantee the conversion of the wicked by bestowing upon them a
perfect vision of himself as the Good.

But in any case, if we take Saul of Tarsus as an example, when Christ appeared
to him, was he coerced into salvation by the will of God? I don’t think so. Or
did he himself choose or will his response to Christ? I don’t think so. I just
don’t see ‘will’ being the primary faculty involved. Rather, he ‘saw’ and then
*naturally* repented and believed. His ‘nous’ was enlightened which then
activated his natural will. If there is anything to this, then what great hope
we might derive from the promise, ‘And every eye I shall see him’ … after
which ‘and every knee shall bow’ would make perfect sense.

For the past century the two principal models of eternal damnation have been
the retributivist and free will. Manis now introduces a third which he
believes expresses the best of both approaches—the divine presence model: God
eternally and only intends the salvation of every human being, but human
beings remain free to definitively reject his gracious gift. “The eternal
suffering of hell,” Manis contends, “is not the result of any divine act that
aims to inflict it, but rather the way that a sinful creature necessarily
experiences the unmitigated presence of a holy God.” Also see my [four-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/book-review-sinners-in-the-
presence-of-a-loving-god/) of the book.

I would see a distinction between the hopeful inclusivism of Ware and
Balthasar and the ultimate redemption of which Gregory (and Macrina) were so
confident. It seems to me that there are two types of hopeful inclusivism that
stop short of Gregory. First, those like Ware and Balthasar who insist on the
possibility (in principle, even if ‘infinitely improbable’) that some might,
in the end, resist divine love because of ‘free will.’ Another version,
somewhat softer, and perhaps in both Origen and Barth, that might say, ‘We
believe is as mystery, but cannot teach it as doctrine,’

What I hear DBH and Fr. Aiden saying is that ultimate redemption need not be
seen as coercive if once the natural will is freed to pursue its natural
desire for God. It seems to me that the gnomic will is actually a dysfunction
of the will (and not the will per se) which must be either healed in order for
us to follow the desire of our natural wills for God … it also seems to me
that this cannot or will not happen for many or even most until we ‘see Christ
face to face.’ To punish someone for all eternity without the benefit of this
healing vision of the ‘serpent on the pole’ would seem very unjust. Hence my
hope in the mercy of Christ at the end.

The classic evangelical work on retributive annihilationism. Not a position
with which I am particularly sympathetic—the hermeneutics that grounds the
project is all wrong, but it contains a lot of useful information.

Dale,  
Those two verses are actually universalist verses. Augustine’s curious
treatment of them was frequently to quote the first half of each (affirming
the universality of the Fall) but almost never the second (affirming the
universality of redemption).  
David

Whether Universalism is correct or not, isn’t believing in Universalism
inherently dangerous, since you include yourself? Isn’t safe route is to
believe like St. Anthony the Great that “all will be saved, only I will
perish”?

However, saying, “I alone will perish” is not a Universalist statement. Are
there other statements that he made suggesting that he was a Universalist?

Think of Ware as the Orthodox counterpart to Balthasar on the topic of the
universa­list hope. Like Balthasar, he does not believe we can affirm anything
stronger than a hope. In Ware’s judgment there is no way to rationally resolve
the irresolvable conflict between divine love and human freedom. All we can do
is to firmly hold them together in tension, “while admitting that the manner
of their ultimate harmonization remains a mystery beyond our present
comprehension.”

In this sophisticted work Griffiths argues for a free-will annihilationism:
human beings are ultimately free to embrace sin and pass into the nothingness
from which they were created. What makes his arguments particularly
interesting—and surprising—is that he is a Roman Catholic who seeks to norm
his reflections by the infallible pronouncements of the Magisterium. With
Balthasar, Griffiths believes that we must pray for the salvation of all,
though he deems the prospect unlikely, although not impossible. He agrees with
the universalist that the traditional claim that God would resurrect the dead
in order to condemn them to everlasting perdition violates the revealed
character of God as infinite and absolute Love.

Guinness it is. My treat. I’m not a fan of beer though. A chilled Pinot Grigio
will do, if David Hart will join.

Dr. Hart, Fr. Kimel, the recent comments here have received a lot of
attention, both positive and negative. Here is some negative attention,
wherein you are referred to as no less than heretics. Unfortunately, it seems
that the author of this blog doesn’t allow comments on his posts.

This book contains three essays by Talbott, followed mainly by critical
evaluations of Talbott’s writings from evangelical biblical scholars,
theologians, philosophers, as well as two essays on the history of
universalism in the Church. The book concludes with a response from Talbott to
his critics. This is an excellent book and well worth adding to one’s library.

You are free to go home after work today, you are free to drink whiskey once
home, you are free to be selfish or unselfish, mean or nice, and so on. But
your free choices have nothing whatsoever to do with choosing between hell or
heaven. Your ultimate destiny is a matter of God’s grace, I would think. But
of course your choices can help decide how you go about getting there. That
is, how God is going to reconcile you to himself, how difficult or easy that
process is is going to depend on your free choices, to some at least limited
extent, I think, choices have consequences after all. Simply put, free will is
not in tension with universal salvation, and I don’t see how one can read Paul
any other way and get it to make sense.

It used to trouble me, as a young aspiring student of Asian religions, that
the typical way in which the work of Christ was preached from pulpits made it
seem not only that our God is morally inferior to the bodhisattva, but that in
fact Christianity was burdened by a thwarted moral imagination, and that the
Mahayana made this obvious. Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald and Isaac of
Ninevah (etc.) prevented me from abandoning the faith as an ungainly alloy of
the ennobling and the barbaric.

As for quoting the anathemas of the 5th Council: again, the council never
really had anything to do with them, they are a separate and irregular set of
condemnations, and even so they do not condemn universalism as such, and if
one cannot see that clearly then one is not reading the text, but only one’s
prejudices through the text.

I know that Maximus often speaks of the gnomic will as simply the sinful and
deviating will. Something tells me–more a phenomenology of consciousness than
a moral metaphysics–that it might be better to think of it as the “third
moment” of the conscious act, so to speak, the first two being the primordial
intention of the natural will and the power of intellect (both being
rational). Then the gnomic will is that supremely rational moment of (ideally)
assent or love or creative liberty that completes the “trinitarian” movement
of the mind and makes it genuinely rationally free.

What a delight to see David Bentley Hart’s thoughts. My own notes were that
two of the texts commonly viewed as signalling eternal punishment were based
on mis-readings by St. Augustine: namely the Romans 5:18, and the I
Corinthians 15:22, as suggested to me by David. I added the specific
references from St. Augustine’s Epistles, and his Contra Jul., again having
pointed in those directions by David. I hope I have the transliterated Greek
accurate.

Andrew Louth is a patristic scholar and one of the foremost Orthodox
theologians in the world. Louth grounds Orthodox reflection on the Last Things
in the Divine Liturgy. Louth notes that “in Orthodox theology a hope of
universal salvation, based on a conviction of the boundlessness of God’s love,
has never gone away.”

As it happens, the next work of technical theology I plan to write is on
precisely that topic. Unfortunately, I have been very ill these past 15
months, so I do not know when or if I shall write it. But my translation, I
hope, will come to be thought of as The Apokatastatic Standard Version.

Discussion of the 5th Ecumenical Council is scattered throughout the blog, but
see especially my comments in [this
interview](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/an-interview-with-fr-
aidan-kimel/). Short answer: (1) it is doubtful that the council itself
dogmatized on the matter, and (2) the version of apokatastasis addressed by
the anti-Origenist anathemas (whatever their dogmatic status may be) touches
the universalist hope as presented by, say, St Gregory of Nyssa or St Isaac of
Nineveh.

Analytic philosophy does not own words like “determined,” incidentally. My
problem is specifically with the current analytic categories of determinism,
compatibilism, libertarian freedom, etc., because they all presume an
originally voluntarist understanding of free will, which is simply incoherent.
When I use “determined” in that sentence, I am just speaking of final
causality, primary causality.

Do the Fathers differ on how free will and providence interact? Absolutely. Do
they differ on how grace and free will relates to “nature” of a person?
Absolutely. Are there various interpretations about how the post-lapsarian
will is wounded? Absolutely. Various interpretations about how a free will
really operates in the eschaton? Absolutely.

I understand (and accept) Plato’s view that all willing is ultimately desire
for the Good in itself. That is a question about the final cause of the will.
But I’m curious: to be truly free does the will necessarily have some kind of
an ‘arbitrary spontaneity’ as an efficient cause?

Is it coherent and rational to think that a fully informed and free
person–i.e., someone who both fully understands that God is his supreme good
and is free from delusion and bondage to disordered desires–would irrevocably
reject absolute Love? Talbott doesn’t think so.

Come to think of it, even the priests I know who reject universalism have
still been very welcoming. For instance, my priest back home (I’m from the
Northwest U.S.) was a fan of Fr. John, but he never saw my inclination towards
universalism as something that should exclude me.

I heard a funny story by Kallistos Ware. He was embarking on a long drive with
another hierarch. He thought to pass the time he would bring this up. Will
even the demons be saved? To which the hierarch boomed, ‘None of your
business,’ and that was that for that topic. 🙂

I take it the first just means the will is empowered by God (given God’s
purposes for its final end, mind you) to say ‘no’ (as well as ‘yes’) to
embracing God as its final end. I’m not sure what you mean by the second
claim. If you mean only that the will can never finally rest in anything other
than God, that God is the only thing it can finally convert to, then yes. But
if you mean that under the right circumstances (say, final judgment) our God-
given power to say ‘no’ can be converted irrespective of its exercise as a
power to interrupt itself, then I’m inclined to disagree…

Have you come across “All Shall Be Well – Explorations in Universal Salvation
and Christian Theology from Origen to Moltmann” edited by (you-know-who)
Gregory MacDonald?  
Among others it contains Origen (obviously), Schleiermacher, P. T. Forsyth,
Barth, Ellul, T  
Robinson, Balthasar and Moltmann. It is an excellent addition to your already
excellent list.

Excellent list. Don’t forget Julian of Norwich! I got started on the path to
full-blown universalism through her, especially in chapter 32 when the Lord
said, “I will preserve My word at every point, and I will make everything well
that is not well.” The fact that He refused to disclose the Great Deed that He
shall do on the Last Day to make all things well inspires us to love, pray,
and hope with complete trust and confidence.

I can’t believe that two heroes of mine (Fr Aidan) and Dr Hart) are denying
it. Christ have mercy… on us all.

A collection of essays dealing with the issues of Hell and identifying pros
and cons in the various views from universalism to acknowledging Hell’s
reality.

Capon described the writing of this book a “watershed experience” and
considered it his most important book. It’s difficult to describe. The first
part is a parable of two adulterous lovers, Paul and Laura, with Caponic
commentary. Many will find the parable scandalous, because the two lovers do
not repent of their sin. Capon, of course, is not endorsing sin (despite
appearances, he is not an antinomian); but he wants us to see that
unconditional love (represented by Laura) transcends moralism. The second part
is an imaginary coffee house Q&A between Capon and his parish­ioners. The
third part is another parable—this time a parable about the gangster-style
execution of a New Jersey mobster. Is it possible for God to forgive murder,
redeem murder? Yes, Capon boldly asserts. Evil is eternally enveloped, judged,
and redeemed within the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Brian Moore–theologian, philosopher, poet, storyteller–has been a gift to
Eclectic Orthodoxy. He has a unique gift to bring to light dimensions of
reality that we usually miss. This article on the greater hope is one of the
finest pieces published on my blog.

Wonderful article and comments. Mr Hart, I’ve ordered your book. One thing I’d
like to add: the idea of ignorance vs knowledge, the force of the final [or
not] ‘No’: this is not always or only ignorance, but pathology. No one
violates free will by healing; the Gospel accounts of, eg, the demoniacs or
paralytics stand for this principle. If a man be healed of the
mental/spiritual pathology that lead him to ‘no’, surely he will say Yes. This
avoids the trap of loss of epistemic distance, I think, because you can posit
resistance to everything except the final force majeure.

Universal salvation is the only “tolerable” answer to evil and suffering in
the world.

Justification by faith proclaims the utter freeness of the grace of God,
gratuitously bestowed on all through the preaching of the good news of Jesus
Christ. Apokatastasis is but the gospel of Christ’s absolute and unconditional
love sung in an eschatological key.

Again, I think compatibilism and determinism are both inapposite to the
question of freedom; they concern a libertarian model of free acts that I
believe logically vacuous. But my hostility towards analytic philosophy and
its native categories occasionally verges on the unreasonable. Simply said,
all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will reach that end,
and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption prevents them; but
rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still, willy-nilly, all
natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as bliss or torment,
but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot not convert the
will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will never be all in
all and creation will never be completed. That teleological understanding of
the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be forced into the
categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I honestly wish
Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories for that
reason.

I am convinced that a failure of imagination partly underlies the resistance
to the greater hope. If a person dies hating and rejecting God, how can God
possibly deliver him or her from that rejection? The medicinal understanding
of purgatory comes to the rescue. That there is a hell for the impenitent, all
universalists affirm. But it is not an everlasting punishment but the painful
redemptive process by which the risen Christ liberates us from our delusions
and addictions and brings us to clear vision of that Love for which each of us
desires.

Dr Hart, is there any more where that came from? You’d be doing English
Letters a great service by publishing more of your short fiction. Truly, these
are some of the most exquisitely written, moving stories I’ve ever read.

“But the the Church dogmatically denounced all expressions of apokatastasis,”
the critic confidently declares, pointing to the anathemas allegedly
pronounced by the Fifth Ecumenical Council. But matters are not so simple. The
anath­emas in question were (1) never formally approved by the Council, (2)
are directed against the strange and esoteric teachings of the 6th century
Origenists, and (3) do not condemn the construals of apokatastasis advanced by
St Gregory of Nyssa, St Isaac of Nineveh, and contemporary proponents of the
greater hope.

I am convinced that this wonderful truth is knocking on the door of Christ’s
church and that we’re on the verge of a reformation of grace that will
ultimately eclipse the one introduced by Martin Luther. Consequently, I have
written and published a book, Dropping Hell and Embracing Grace, by Ivan A.
Rogers, available from Amazon.com, also on Kindle. The book has been well-
received; a welcome addition to the exciting discussion of universalism.

Pass me a pint gentlemen! Brian, very helpful. Thank you. I’ll look up William
D as well.

Harmon examines how Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St Gregory of Nyssa
sought to ground their hope for universal salvation in the biblical story and

I know you said και τα λοιπα. But I’ll add, just for diligence sake, Rom.
9.16, 5.20.

Keith DeRose is not a biblical scholar. He is a philosopher at Yale
University. Like Tom Talbott, he believes that the Apostle Paul ultimately
taught a doctrine of uni­versal salvation. He begins his article with this
judgment: “Contrary to what many would suppose, universalism … receives strong
scriptural support in the New Testament. Indeed, I judge the support strong
enough that if I had to choose between universalism and anti-universalism as
the ‘position of Scripture,’ I’d pick universalism as the fairly clear
winner.” I certainly would not say a “clear winner,” but the case is stronger
than many believe.

I’m not sure I’d word it that way, but what I would say is that some ignorance
is inevitable. Infinite knowledge is not a possibility for a finite being. I
like to say that my head just isn’t big enough to stuff the whole universe and
its God inside. There will always be more questions unanswered than those to
which we have answers, and a discussion of this sort simply cannot have a
terminus ad quem, for inevitably there will be more to know. We can only
guess, with greater or lesser probability. But I can only suspect that God,
given an infinity of time in which to show infinite mercy will ultimately
teach us enough to incline us to acceptance of the Cross and Resurrection, of
the ultimate gift of Christ.

The greater hope is ultimately grounded in a vision of God as absolute,
unconditional Love. If this vision is true, then the doctrine of everlasting
damnation becomes both incomprehensible and morally intolerable.

This article may be the best introduction to Talbott’s approach to universal
salvation. Start here! After you have read this, you should have a good idea
whether you want to read anymore of Talbott’s work.

My struggle in understanding the inescapable conclusion of universalism still
rests in not understanding why a human person is not capable of continually
refusing to accept God’s salvific offer of Himself in Christ. So I have a
couple questions which might help further clarify the argument.

I think I see where you’re coming from Shane. For my part, this is where I
imagine (with Paul, I think, in 1 Cor. 15) that omnipotent love graciously
initiates the parousia in all its efficacy, and everlasting blessedness is not
something we can either achieve by our goodness or sabotage by our delusions …
Rather, when the True Light shines, the darkness of delusion will be dispelled
and healing love will do its work on our hearts … the synergism of this, I
hope, will be the genuine, willing response of someone being brought back from
the dead (DBH’s ‘third moment’). In other words, we’re counting on a love
greater in its illuminating power than the blindness of whatever veils of
unbelief and defiance we’ve pulled over our own eyes.

Yakoov, St Isaac the Syrian certainly thought so. See my series on [Isaac and
universalism](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/st-isaac-the-syrian-
preaching-the-astonishing-love-of-god/).

This book shares Capon’s reflections on the parables of Jesus. Each parable,
Capon believes, witnesses to the kingdom now present in Christ, a kingdom that
Jesus gifts to his hearers. Even the parables of judgment witness to the
unconditional love of Christ and his Father. Yes, his exegesis is sometimes
off-the-wall and unconvincing, yet that is what can be so helpful to us. We
need to have our expectations turned upside-down and inside-out.

That’s an interesting question. I don’t quite understand why a finite and
imperfect being might be capable of achieving everlasting blessedness but not
capable of enacting an everlasting tragedy. In addition, I don’t see why an
ever increased pursuit by God must result in the eventual conversion of the
pursued as opposed to the possibility of an everlasting evasion by the
pursued. I am inclined to think that it becomes harder, not easier, to turn to
God the more a person rejects God. But, like I said, I might be missing
something in the argument, or I might be questioning with unconscious and
false presuppositions about the nature of human being.

Before a person can seriously entertain the universalist hope, he must become
per­suaded that the the Father of Jesus Christ loves sinners absolutely,
uncondi­tion­ally, nontransactionally. I can think of no better theologian to
assist us in grasping this truth than Robert Capon—not because Capon is a
theologian of the first-rank (he doesn’t even belong to the second-rank), but
because he has an uncanny ability to think outside the conditionalist box.
Such an ability is necessary when interpreting the New Testament as
eschatological discourse. Capon also has a whimsical writing style that often
makes me chuckle (and sometimes cringe).

Let me try to clarify. Let’s reserve ‘freedom’ for that mode of human agency
fulfilled and glorified in God, our truest freedom in Christ. Let ‘agency’
describe that mode of the will en route to such freedom. I’m suggesting only
that the latter be characterized by a certain epistemic distance/space and
that this distance serves a good purpose, namely, it’s an essential part of
what makes it possible for finite created beings such as ourselves to come to
be free (in the former sense) in God. So ‘freedom’ is the result of a
particular exercise of an ‘agency’ that is sufficiently informed but not
overwhelmed as such.

Christ will remain there with him.”

Fr. Aiden, and perhaps even David Hart, if one or both would do me the honor
of helping me with a confusion I am having in regards to apokatastasis.  
First, an little background, I have not been received in the church, am merely
a pilgrim searching for truth, but the E.O. church saved my faith a few years
ago and has enlightened much of my theology since then, But I haven’t been
able to make the leap yet, which allows me a large berth in my eclecticness,
but the idea of joining is always in the back of my mind, and so I am always
trying to align myself, the best I can to the church, and so with that, in
regards to this, I thought the church condemned this at the 5th ecumenical
council if I may copy and paste from orthodoxwiki:  
– If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the
monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema. (First
anathema against Origen)  
-If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united in one, when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall have disappeared, and that the knowledge of the world to come will carry with it the ruin of the worlds, and the rejection of bodies as also the abolition of [all] names, and that there shall be finally an identity of the γνῶσις and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema. (Fourteenth anathema against Origen)2

“On the one hand, Maximus foresees the restoration of the natural will and
speaks of the purifying fire of the Second Coming, something that implies an
end to the puri­fication process, but, on the other hand, he emphasizes the
final rest. Perhaps the answer can be found in a comment from the Q.Thal. 22
(Laga–Steel 1980: 139. 66–141. 80) where Maximus draws a distinction between
the present age, the ‘age of the flesh’, which is characterized by doing, and
the age of the Spirit that will be charac­terized by ‘undergoing’. This
suggests that the final rest will not be a static rest, but that some kind of
activity is conceivable. In addition, it is not specified if the activity of
that age is limited to the righteous only: the analogy to the age of doing
suggests the opposite. Is it possible, then, that with the mysterious phrase
‘ever-moving rest’ ( _ἀεικίνητος στάσις_ ), the Confessor envisioned a rest
similar to the unification of the soul with God, as described by Gregory of
Nyssa, where the soul moves infinitely towards God without ever being able to
reach the end of infinity, but experiencing and participating increasingly in
the divine energies? The ‘undergoing’ of the sinful souls might then be
translated into the contrition and repentance they never had in life, which
could perhaps even then bring them closer to God, while the righteous advance
in their blissful participation of the divine. Something like that would be
consistent with the possibility of a final restoration of all and with
Maximus’ views on the rest. This active rest would have to be understood as an
unchangeable condition, in spite of the movement or undergoing of the souls,
something that would satisfy its position at the end of the Maximian
cosmological triad as the conclusion. It would also mean that it is not
necessary to envision an ontological difference between the righteous and the
wicked, as there is not one now.”

I am pretty sure that if this was a dream I would be married to Kate Upton.

Dear me, you really think those are interpolations? That is something of a
joke in scholarly circles. Especially since it would basically mean that
Gregory’s whole theology, from the ground up, as unfolded in De anima et
resurrectione and De hominis opificio and the Great Oration and the Psalms
commentary is an interpolation. Maybe Gregory never really wrote anything
(rather like the Oxfordian hyposthesis about Shakespeare). Something similar
is true in Isaac’s case. And those two are far from being the only patristic
universalists; both of the very distinct Alexandrian (including Cappadocian)
and Antiochene tradition are full of them, from the days of Pantaenus to the
13th century writings of Solomon of Bostra. Goodness, there are almost
overwhelming reasons to believe Gregory Nazianzen, and even Athanasius and
Cyril of Alexandria, were so disposed (Gregory unquestionably, really).

As for Princeton, it is all a matter of health. I’m afraid I don’t know
anything about the next two years. Kind of you to ask, though.

A bit of Ratzinger ( _Eschatology_ , pp. 215ff.) to add to the discussion:

It is generally assumed by Orthodox believers that the doctrine of everlasting
damnation enjoys the status of irreformable or infallible dogma. It is
therefore necessary to examine the nature of dogma and what it means, at least
for the Orthodox, to characterize a dogmatic statement as irreformable. As we
see in this article, matters are more complex than popularly taught,
especially when it comes to eschatological questions.

“Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the teaching
of eternal perdition became the teaching of the Church.”

Christianity. This essay is particularly valuable for the copious quotations

That Nazianzus gathers and affirms the philocalia of Origen seems a part of
the same project. It would have saved us some pain if they had formally
declared Origen a father at their council. However, it is not without import
that Benedict XVI numbered Origen as one of the fathers in his book on the
Fathers.

“Grigio” is a euphemism for “blush.” I’m a noir man all the way, if it’s good.

By the way, the picture of free will advanced here is essentially that of
Maximus the Confessor.

I had a professor in seminary that spoke of one theory that arises from the
question, “What about the salvation of God’s chosen people the Jews? (for the
evangelicals) Those before Jesus that it was and could have been credited to
them salvation by faith). And the theory went something like this: When Jesus
returns EVERYONE is resurrected and every tongue confessing and every knee
bowing that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, Lord, and King. And it would be at
that point that the Jews would see the messiah coming in the way that they
have always been expecting. And everyone would be able to either recognize the
one and true God and choose to continue to be in relationship with the God, or
they would be wooed by the Holy Spirit to desire to start that relationship
beyond this life. And of course, for anyone that chooses to not be in
relationship with our three-fold Godhead, then there would be a place for them
that would not be in the presence and relationship with God, and that would be
like eternal torment to choose to not be in a relationship with the Trinity
that they were create to be in.

Balthasar is well known for his advocacy of a non-necessary universalist hope:
we may and should hope that God will save all, but we must not presume that he
will. Wood finds Balthasar’s position unsatisfactory and commends as an
alternative the bold and confident hope of George MacDonald.

Even so, I still cannot grant the liceity of the way you formulate freedom.
Part of it is that there is a difference between being “informed” in the
modern sense (possessing “information” and then, in a second movement of
deliberation, deciding upon it based upon some distinct set of criteria) and
being truly “in-formed” in the classical sense of being reshaped by the glory
of God. God is not a species of cognitive information in the former sense,
some finite object available to my judicious gaze. To know God is to be
transfigured into what is revealed. At that point of truest liberty, freedom
and necessity are no longer distinguished, any more than they are in the
Father’s own love of his own essence in the Son and Spirit. Remember, the only
thing to which Paul says we are predestined (well, marked out for in advance,
really) is to be conformed to the image of Christ. No less austerely apophatic
thinker than Maximus says that we achieve freedom (and are perfect as Christ’s
Father is perfect) when all distance (diastema) disappears and we rush into
the embrace of love.

To be honest, the rhetoric is stirring, but I find the reasoning a little
banal, for the reasons I have already enunciated. And exegetically poor. It
reduces freedom to mere libertarian optionalism (to use some jargon) and God
to an option among options (a thing among things). It is a defense of an
indefensible doctrinal tradition, heroic but hopeless.

A helpful summary of how the question of Satan’s ultimate salvation has been
addressed by Christian theologians down through the centuries. “From the
outset,” Patrides writes, “one element clearly emerges: the conviction that
God’s love is all-inclusive and irresistible. The crucial issue, which
orthodox theologians repeatedly failed to grasp, was never whether Satan
should be, or could be, redeemed, but whether Divine Love may be limited in
any way, even to the extent of Satan’s exclusion from Grace.”

Human beings are not created in a neutral state _vis-à-vis_ their Creator.
They are created with a natural desire for union with him.

George MacDonald’s sermon “Love Thy Neighbour” has a passage so reminiscent of
Silouan’s remark that it is almost difficult to keep them distinct in one’s
memory.

Dr Parry’s contribution to this volume is one of the single best introductions
to universal salvation. Highly recommended.

From what I have read, I personally would not describe either [St
Silouan](http://www.bogoslov.ru/en/text/2314168.html) or Elder Sophrony as
explicit universalists; rather, they appear to leave open the possibility of
universal salvation.

First read Brad Jersak’s article “[Apocatastatic
Hymnody](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/let-every-mortal-leap-for-
joy-apocatastatic-hymnody-in-orthodox-worship/)” and then follow up with this
article. In addition to noting the universalist-orientation of Orthodox
hymnody, Howell also discusses the Last Judgment hymns, often cited as
testimony for the everlasting damnation position. His conclusion: when we
read, hear, and sing the hymns of the Orthodox Church, “we realize that the
universalist hope never did disappear” in the life of the Church.

Fr. Aiden, if I might also include this beautiful quote from Catholic
theologian, Gustave Martelet, at the end of his article on hell in the ECT:

_That All Shall Be Saved_ is profitably read alongside the metaphysical essays
contained in [_The Hidden and the
Manifest_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802865968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&camp89&creativeÂ25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN02865968&linkIdâa367c7766fadca06068c9bb6f10ccf),
especially “Impassibility as Transcendence.”

This has been one of my favorites since it was first published in 1990. The
influence of C. S. Lewis upon Kreeft is manifest. It was here that I first
encountered the view that purgatory is an anteroom of heaven.

Now I may be very wrong in my attempts to speak of what Austin Farrer calls
“double agency,” but it is also very wrong to call it heresy. The Orthodox
Church hasn’t even considered this difficult question at the depth it needs to
be considered before any such judgment can be made. But let’s assume the
libertarians are right. We can still proclaim the universalist hope: see
“[What are the Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-
salvation-what-are-the-odds/)” Hope this helps.

If you consult the (very dubious) records of the council, you will find
something called Origenism condemned. But no authentic finding of the council
condemns universalism as such.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything determines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attributing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. However, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

Emanation](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/aviccenac2b4s-julie-

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and damnation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soteriological mission of cross and resurrection, not
as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From the
beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

> We have already seen that to call the One ’cause’ in fact means only that
> all things depend on the One in order to be. It follows that the One’s

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Posted on [14 July 2018](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/ "6:43 am") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr
Aidan Kimel")

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

> Dionysius’ presentation of God as productive Love raises the much-vexed
> question of whether, for Dionysius, God makes all things “freely” or “by
> necessity.” The entire issue is almost always misconceived, because it is
> usually assumed that to say that God creates “freely” means that he “might
> not create,” and that he “chooses” between possible alternatives to creating
> and not creating; while, conversely, to say that there is no such choice
> between possible alternatives, that God “cannot” not create, means that he
> is subject to some “necessity.” ([
> _Theophany_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791471128/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN91471128&linkIdÇb04e61e77e1c94bd9703fe2dee3af0),
> p. 49)

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and

Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

> God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before us, that we shall
> see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new
> heavens and the new earth, in every created thing which shall then exist;
> and also by the body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision of
> the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. (DCD XXII, 29)

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

> A properly theological cosmology and ‘history of salvation—the economy or
> the plan of salvation—begins with the Passion of Christ, and from this
> vantage point looks backwards and forwards to see everything in this light.9

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

> And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I
> teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of
> the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you. (Dt 4:1)

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

> Certainly there was an Eden on this very unhappy earth. We all long for it,
> and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least
> corrupted, its gentlest and most humane, is still soaked with the sense of
> “exile.”

> God to the Rabbis is certainly both Lawgiver and Judge, and even the Pauline

> in this world and in the next. But how can you call that Lawgiver stern and
> cruel who gives the laws for the benefit of his creatures, and who is
> ceaseless in his love for them, who pities them in their sorrows, and on the
> smallest pretext of repentance hastens to forgive them their sins?3

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

> The story of the Garden of Eden is not descriptive but rather proleptic: it
> lets an echo of the end be heard in the beginning, as often in music one
> hears at the beginning of a composition a theme that will be developed only

> [Maximus, _CT_ 1.66].13

> For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you,
> neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will

[St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible? →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-
augustine-on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Is the “freedom” to sell yourself into slavery or lock yourself in a cage
actual freedom? It seems more like a limitation of the will to me.

I know you said και τα λοιπα. But I’ll add, just for diligence sake, Rom.
9.16, 5.20.

I suppose we all for that. But, really, no citing if crucial texts in dubious
translations–that must be a rule. If Gregory of Nyssa talks of Judas suffering
“eis ton aiona,” then quote him as doing so, as well as the many instances
where he makes clear how he understands that biblical phrase. “Unto infinity”
forsooth. One of the first things to learn about Gregory is that every version
of “infinite” in Greek–apeiron, aperilepton, eyc–is a privileged name for the
divine nature. _Die Unendlichkeit Gottes bei Gregor von Nyssa_ (E. Mühlenberg)
might have been one of the earliest books I read on Gregory’s metaphysics,
flawed though that book is.

That’s an interesting question. I don’t quite understand why a finite and
imperfect being might be capable of achieving everlasting blessedness but not
capable of enacting an everlasting tragedy. In addition, I don’t see why an
ever increased pursuit by God must result in the eventual conversion of the
pursued as opposed to the possibility of an everlasting evasion by the
pursued. I am inclined to think that it becomes harder, not easier, to turn to
God the more a person rejects God. But, like I said, I might be missing
something in the argument, or I might be questioning with unconscious and
false presuppositions about the nature of human being.

A helpful introduction to universalist reflection in the patristic Church,
with special focus on Origen, St Gregory of Nazianzus, and St Gregory of
Nyssa.

A brilliant exposition of the critical assertion in Sergius Bulgakov’s
universalist eschatology that at the Second Coming all will love Christ.

This book shares Capon’s reflections on the parables of Jesus. Each parable,
Capon believes, witnesses to the kingdom now present in Christ, a kingdom that
Jesus gifts to his hearers. Even the parables of judgment witness to the
unconditional love of Christ and his Father. Yes, his exegesis is sometimes
off-the-wall and unconvincing, yet that is what can be so helpful to us. We
need to have our expectations turned upside-down and inside-out.

Andreano identifies the misconceptions many people have about what
universalists believe and answers the common objections advanced against the
greater hope.

I think I’m tracking with you … so might we say that the showing and seeing is
what heals (rather than coerces) the gnomic will such that neither God’s self-
revelation nor our natural response (of both nous in seeing and will in
following) can be charged with voluntarism?

Bringing together Origen, St Gregory Nyssen, and George MacDonald, Ross argues
that universal salvation “entails a concept of judgment just as exacting, just
as rigorous, and every bit as righteous as the sort of purely punitive
punishment on offer in any version of the doctrine of eternal damnation.”

Wonderful quotation, Brad. Thanks for sharing it. And thanks for the link to
the Turnicev article.

Fr. Aiden, and perhaps even David Hart, if one or both would do me the honor
of helping me with a confusion I am having in regards to apokatastasis.  
First, an little background, I have not been received in the church, am merely
a pilgrim searching for truth, but the E.O. church saved my faith a few years
ago and has enlightened much of my theology since then, But I haven’t been
able to make the leap yet, which allows me a large berth in my eclecticness,
but the idea of joining is always in the back of my mind, and so I am always
trying to align myself, the best I can to the church, and so with that, in
regards to this, I thought the church condemned this at the 5th ecumenical
council if I may copy and paste from orthodoxwiki:  
– If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the
monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema. (First
anathema against Origen)  
-If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united in one, when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall have disappeared, and that the knowledge of the world to come will carry with it the ruin of the worlds, and the rejection of bodies as also the abolition of [all] names, and that there shall be finally an identity of the γνῶσις and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema. (Fourteenth anathema against Origen)2

Cheers.

to chat offline now and then if you’re open to it, Brian. You can help me with

You know, I’ve tried to talk about all this before and I never feel I quite
communicate what I hope to — or perhaps I am simply not as persuasive as I
would like to be. Here’s another attempt.

Since its publication in 1899, this book has been the standard historical work
on the universalist sympathies of the Church Fathers. Its scholarship is
dated—it should be read alongside Ramelli’s _The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis_ —but it remains a useful resource. An online version can be
found at [Tentmaker.org](https://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html).

“To those who accept and transmit the vain Greek teachings that there is a
pre-existence of souls and teach that all things were not produced and did not
come into existence out of non-being, that there is an end to the torment or a
restoration again of creation and of human affairs, meaning by such teachings
that the Kingdom of the Heavens is entirely perishable and fleeting, whereas
the Kingdom is eternal and indissoluble as Christ our God Himself taught and
delivered to us, and **as we have ascertained from the entire Old and New
Scripture, that the torment is unending and the Kingdom everlasting to those
who by such teachings both destroy themselves and become agents of eternal
condemnation to others** ,  
Anathema, Anathema, Anathema! [my emphasis].”

Have you read “Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives”? In it, Elder Thaddeus
presents an image of heaven/hell that I don’t think fits into the “River of
Fire” or Divine Retribution categories.

This is an important essay (also included in revised form in _That All Shall
Be Saved_ ). Hart discusses the question of eternal damnation and theodicy and
comes down firmly in favor of the universalist vision of St Gregory of Nyssa.
Hart boldly declares that the Christian confession that God is absolute Love
and Goodness, when combined with the equally Christian confession that God has
freely created the world from nothing­ness, excludes the traditional expousal
of the eternal damnation of the wicked. If God is truly good, then he would
never accept the risk that even one of his beloved would be eternally lost.
Humanity has been made by God for God: “To see the good truly is to desire it
insatiably; not to desire it is not to have known it, and so never to have
been free to choose it.”

The example of the Bodhisattva is always in the back of my mind. Shantideva’s
Bodhicaryavatara should be required reading for all Christian theologians.
Technically, in the Mahayana–of any inflection (my favorite being Yogacara or
Citta matra, but that’s neither here nor there), the Bodhisattva does not
refuse enlightenment. He is, in fact, fully awakened. But, out of the
superabundance of his metta (compassionate love) and karuna (mercy), he vows
not to “pass over” into Nibbana until all other sentient beings are ushered
in. And this very act is the supreme enlightenment, because in being set free
from tanha absolutely by his compassion he learns that “Samsara and Nibbana
are one”–for, in the eyes of charity, paradise is the compassion that prompts
the great vow.

(and then you could go into Revelation with the gates in the Holy City as
being open and not gated… but it could be argued that that was a
representation of the current realities of those that belong to the Kingdom
and the holy city is a representation of the Christian faith at the time when
John the Revelator wrote the book on the island.)

May I turn the question back upon yourself? If God were to say to one of two
things to you, either “My dear Yaakov, I love you ultimately and absolutely
and I will always find a way to turn your heart to me, no matter what” or
“Yaakov, you are right, only you will perish and there’s nothing I can do to
save you,” which word would you find most encouraging, most transformative?

Conversion](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/we-shall-see-him-as-he-

2) If it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s gift throughout their
whole life in this world, why is it not possible for a human person to
continue to do so after he or she has has died? I suppose, ultimately, I don’t
understand why, if it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s offer
once, it is not possible for them to refuse it on and on for the rest of their
existence. I don’t in anyway think that people must do that. I don’t see why
it’s not a possibility though.

Is it coherent and rational to think that a fully informed and free
person–i.e., someone who both fully understands that God is his supreme good
and is free from delusion and bondage to disordered desires–would irrevocably
reject absolute Love? Talbott doesn’t think so.

Balthasar is well known for his advocacy of a non-necessary universalist hope:
we may and should hope that God will save all, but we must not presume that he
will. Wood finds Balthasar’s position unsatisfactory and commends as an
alternative the bold and confident hope of George MacDonald.

The 5th Ecumenical Council rejected universalism. Dare we think we know better
than the 5th Ecumenical Council? No.

Ramelli explores Origen’s and St Gregory Nyssen’s integration of philosophy
and biblical exegesis in their reflections on apokatastasis. If you can’t
afford her mono­graph (who can?), then by all means take a look at this essay.
Ramelli believes that Origen (and by implication Gregory) has been
misunderstood and misrepresented by the ecclesiastical tradition. He certainly
was no Origenist.

Daniel, have you considered the possibility that you are confusing creaturely
causality and divine causality? As I have expressed in a couple of my past
postings, popular understandings of synergism appear to put God in the same
metaphysical level (just as so many analytic philosophers do today). Hence
they present human freedom and divine action as mutually competitive. But this
simply cannot be the right way to think about the relationship between the
Transcendence and human beings. Take a look at these past articles of mine:

Potentially, every source of delusion would be removed or healed when we ‘see
him face to face’ … the telos would be an experience of pure clarity to a
graciously restored mind and will.

I’m not sure I’d word it that way, but what I would say is that some ignorance
is inevitable. Infinite knowledge is not a possibility for a finite being. I
like to say that my head just isn’t big enough to stuff the whole universe and
its God inside. There will always be more questions unanswered than those to
which we have answers, and a discussion of this sort simply cannot have a
terminus ad quem, for inevitably there will be more to know. We can only
guess, with greater or lesser probability. But I can only suspect that God,
given an infinity of time in which to show infinite mercy will ultimately
teach us enough to incline us to acceptance of the Cross and Resurrection, of
the ultimate gift of Christ.

Either we have free will now with the ability to permanently and eternally
reject God, and God efficaciously and therefore irresistibly changes the human
will in the eschaton to choose God permanently, *OR* we don’t have free will
now, and the change that God does upon us in the eschaton gives us will that
is truly free and we thus choose God freely for eternally.

and cons in the various views from universalism to acknowledging Hell’s

A helpful summary of the eschatological views of St Isaac of Nineveh.
Hryniewicz concludes his article with these words: “Today, after the twelve
centuries which have elapsed since the times of Isaac the Syrian, one reads
his texts with deep affection and sincere admiration. His universal hope makes
him one of the greatest guides and teachers, especially in theological
thinking about the world to come.”

I’m sure Ilaria Ramelli’s recent tome “The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis” will become an essential standard.

The radical unconditionality of divine grace is the evangelical heart of the
theological writings of Robert Farrar Capon. So why isn’t he proponent of
universal salvation?

For the past century the two principal models of eternal damnation have been
the retributivist and free will. Manis now introduces a third which he
believes expresses the best of both approaches—the divine presence model: God
eternally and only intends the salvation of every human being, but human
beings remain free to definitively reject his gracious gift. “The eternal
suffering of hell,” Manis contends, “is not the result of any divine act that
aims to inflict it, but rather the way that a sinful creature necessarily
experiences the unmitigated presence of a holy God.” Also see my [four-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/book-review-sinners-in-the-

Andreano explores what Origen really taught about the eternal destiny of
Satan. Some fascinating material here. After you’ve read this, read Bulgakov’s
essay “On the Question of the Apocatastasis of the Fallen Spirits.” Makes for
an interesting comparison.

For my own part, it does not bother me that Fr. John holds the opinions he
does, but rather that he wishes to exalt his personal theologumena to doctrine
to which all Orthodox Christians ought to adhere. He wishes for Orthodoxy to
preach doctrine that, in all honesty, would likely have kept me from ever
converting to the faith.

I am not good at web-exchanges, since I don’t like being on the computer, and
these days I don’t have much energy. So you may have to wait for my next book
for my answer. But two quick answers:

Brian Moore–theologian, philosopher, poet, storyteller–has been a gift to
Eclectic Orthodoxy. He has a unique gift to bring to light dimensions of
reality that we usually miss. This article on the greater hope is one of the
finest pieces published on my blog.

Brad’s book is perhaps the best book on hell that I have read

My question (possibly related to your comment above on the gnomic will and its
ultimate indistinction from the natural will) has to do with created agency as
fulfilled in Christ and enjoying a ‘scope of loving possibilities’ within
which to freely/creatively determine how it shall reflect divine beauties.
Going with Certeau’s suggestion, might we imagine the logoi of created beings
as embodying or specifying a “range” or “scope” (a pallet?) of beautiful
expression and not the particular of every form? The divine will (or logoi)
would terminate not in the final form of creaturely expression but in the
range of creative possibilities offered to creatures to uniquely shape their
expressive form (unique not in the creation of beauties not already comprised
in Christ as the summum bonum, but simply as the creature’s contribution to
the consummate beauty of ends synergistically achieved). Would the gnomic will
retain a unique function in this case?

That it may generate despair and scrupulosity, I’ll give you that. But that it
violates unconditional love? I don’t understand that. If anything, it
generates and exhibits a spirit of humility, love, and forgiveness.

_That All Shall Be Saved_ is profitably read alongside the metaphysical essays
contained in [_The Hidden and the
Manifest_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802865968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&camp89&creativeÂ25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN02865968&linkIdâa367c7766fadca06068c9bb6f10ccf),
especially “Impassibility as Transcendence.”

Ummm… and I don’t mean to upset David, who is a friend and wonderful
theologian and philosopher (and thank God for that- I go mad wishing to help
Polkinghorne with some understanding of epistemology) but he writes splendidly
with his futuristic computer thing!

Bernier is a Byzantine Catholic theologian. In this thoughtful piece, he asks
the question why should we question the doctrine of everlasting damnation. His
answer is blunt: we must question it because it is “mon­strous, plain and
simple.”

I’ll presume to suggest my own work, ‘Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hope, Hell
and the New Jerusalem,’ (Wipf and Stock, 2009), which offers a chapter on
Jesus in the Jeremiah tradition, where he consciously quotes or alludes to
every chapter of Jeremiah where ‘the Valley of Hinnom’ is mentioned (and is
symbolic of the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon – i.e. literal destruction) …
surely this plays into Jesus’ use of gehenna in conjunction with the
forthcoming siege in 70. (in part).

I now see that David responded to that in his comments above. Thank you.

He’s ever so much more than an actor. He’s a natural phenomenon as grand, in
his way, as Niagara Falls or Mt Fuji.

Silouan did Not dogmatically assert apokatastasis. He certainly held to more
than a mere hope. Sophrony too. This is not something they hid. Merely read
them.

Ah, yes, I like this:  
“Perhaps God pursue us ‘as long as it takes’?”  
For many decades I have inclined toward a universalist view, pretty much since
reading Hosea Ballou’s “Ancient History of Universalism” (a mid-19th century
volume that I still have, buried somewhere in my library). “Inclined” as I do
not believe there is adequate conclusive evidence, either in Scripture or
Tradition, that any of us are qualified to claim knowledge of what is the
reality of “the other side”. I do believe in Hell, but I don’t know what I
believe about it. I do believe in the possibility of a permanent rejection of
God, but find it very difficult to believe that anyone (even including him
that once was Lucifer) can hold out against increasing knowledge through all
eternity,  
and I have become convinced that something resembling Purgatory has a far
greater likelihood than does an eternal hell. God’s mercy is infinite, He
desireth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should live. All that
being said, the operative thought is that we simply cannot know, not having
been conclusively told, but that we can certainly trust and hope in that
boundless mercy. It is not so much what we do with our free will, but what
Jesus has done on the Cross that matters. If He has declared us saved, so we
are, but if our flawed and twisted will has not accepted that, perhaps his
call and his teaching will ultimately bring us to a place of healing. There is
time enough and more. Perhaps it’s like what my Dad always said about how he
came to be married: “She kept on chasing me … until I caught her.”  
cf. Francis Thomson’s. “Hound of Heaven”>

Dr. Hart, Fr. Kimel, the recent comments here have received a lot of
attention, both positive and negative. Here is some negative attention,
wherein you are referred to as no less than heretics. Unfortunately, it seems
that the author of this blog doesn’t allow comments on his posts.

So, rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in
a kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny. I maintain that the original gift of being
involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some level,
but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream, play,
wonder, creativity and loving encounter. It’s hard to talk about and
impossible to comprehend. I take it that all our acts of compassion, of
delight, discovery, and insight are those which bring us closer to who we are
meant to be. Also, doubtless, we all fail to attain this calling. Some fail
miserably. I understand the parable of the sheep and goats to be largely
intrapersonal in nature.

I have always liked Mr. Blessed’s work. It cheers my heart to hear this.

What I hear DBH and Fr. Aiden saying is that ultimate redemption need not be
seen as coercive if once the natural will is freed to pursue its natural
desire for God. It seems to me that the gnomic will is actually a dysfunction
of the will (and not the will per se) which must be either healed in order for
us to follow the desire of our natural wills for God … it also seems to me
that this cannot or will not happen for many or even most until we ‘see Christ
face to face.’ To punish someone for all eternity without the benefit of this
healing vision of the ‘serpent on the pole’ would seem very unjust. Hence my
hope in the mercy of Christ at the end.

Like you, St. Isaac had a huge influence on me, hence my baptismal name.
Nobody here will turn you away for that. It is a great, thoughtful and
welcoming community that will be happy to have you.

Oh, so kind. Again, health is the issue. I began a collection of 25
“parables,,” the first of which appeared as a Back Page column called The True
Helen. I hope to return to that book when I feel well enough. And the. There
is a good deal more fiction I want to write. That was originally what I
planned to do with my life.

I live in Atlanta, have for many years, but my heart is in Western New York
where I grew up.  
Academia avoided me as much as I avoided it, though I was never really keen to
participate.  
Petty, corrupt, earnest about the wrong things, if it’s ever right to be
earnest, and uninterested in what really matters. The only actual career I can
ever remember wanting doesn’t really qualify, I suppose. At some point early
in my youth I wanted to be Capt. Kirk. Not an astronaut, mind you, just
Captain Kirk. (I am a year older than you, btw.) I work as a drudge grading
SAT essays for a national tutoring company. This allows me to eat and to feed
my old Persian cat and the many ferals that I somehow became benefactor to. I
write on Father Kimel’s blog, because he is a terrific priest and I rarely
find a place with an atmosphere congenial to my tastes. I have not attempted
to be published anywhere. When I can find the energy, I work on fiction,
because I think what the world needs is better images to nurture a more true
understanding. I don’t generally get too far with it, but it keeps me
relatively sane.

Written a decade after his _Theandros_ essay, and taking into account more
recent scholarship, Andreapoulos elaborates on the eschatological perspectives
of St Maximus. As in his earlier essay, he believes that the logic of
Maximus’s ontological and anthropological reflections leave open the
possibility of universal salvation. Regarding apokatastasis Andreapoulos
concludes:

Some other universalist voices: St. Silouan the Athonite and (according to Fr.
Cyril Hovorun and Balthasar) probably Maximus the Confessor.

The classic evangelical work on retributive annihilationism. Not a position
with which I am particularly sympathetic—the hermeneutics that grounds the
project is all wrong, but it contains a lot of useful information.

“St. Paul would be wretched before the throne of God, if he thought there was
one man beyond the pale of His mercy, and that as much for God’s glory as for
the man’s sake. And what shall we say of the man Christ Jesus? Who, that loves
his brother, would not, upheld by the love of Christ, and with a dim hope that
in the far-off time there might be some help for him, arise from the company
of the blessed, and walk down into the dismal regions of despair, to sit with
the last, the only unredeemed, the Judas of his race, and be himself more
blessed in the pains of hell, than in the glories of heaven?

1) Do you think it is possible for a human person to either accept or refuse
God’s gift of salvation in Christ?

_I have not read everything on the universalist hope, nor have I read all of
the books and articles that others deem essential. But I thought it might be
helpful to others to share the essential stuff that I have read and found
helpful:_

To the list of “Julian was NOT a universalist” scholars you may add Fr. John
Julian, OJN, whose translation and commentary are published by Paraclete Press
under the title “The Complete Julian of Norwich”. Among other things, he
points out that she frequently used the phrase “all who shall be saved”,
implying that not all will be saved. Certainly she was not an avowed
universalist as were Saints Gregory of Nyssa of Isaac the Syrian. However, I
think she was so in pectore, but given the doctrinal and ecclesiastical
climate of Fourteenth Century England, she could only lead her reader to that
truth inferentially. And I think she does so beautifully.

“On the one hand, Maximus foresees the restoration of the natural will and
speaks of the purifying fire of the Second Coming, something that implies an
end to the puri­fication process, but, on the other hand, he emphasizes the
final rest. Perhaps the answer can be found in a comment from the Q.Thal. 22
(Laga–Steel 1980: 139. 66–141. 80) where Maximus draws a distinction between
the present age, the ‘age of the flesh’, which is characterized by doing, and
the age of the Spirit that will be charac­terized by ‘undergoing’. This
suggests that the final rest will not be a static rest, but that some kind of
activity is conceivable. In addition, it is not specified if the activity of
that age is limited to the righteous only: the analogy to the age of doing
suggests the opposite. Is it possible, then, that with the mysterious phrase
‘ever-moving rest’ ( _ἀεικίνητος στάσις_ ), the Confessor envisioned a rest
similar to the unification of the soul with God, as described by Gregory of
Nyssa, where the soul moves infinitely towards God without ever being able to
reach the end of infinity, but experiencing and participating increasingly in
the divine energies? The ‘undergoing’ of the sinful souls might then be
translated into the contrition and repentance they never had in life, which
could perhaps even then bring them closer to God, while the righteous advance
in their blissful participation of the divine. Something like that would be
consistent with the possibility of a final restoration of all and with
Maximus’ views on the rest. This active rest would have to be understood as an
unchangeable condition, in spite of the movement or undergoing of the souls,
something that would satisfy its position at the end of the Maximian
cosmological triad as the conclusion. It would also mean that it is not
necessary to envision an ontological difference between the righteous and the
wicked, as there is not one now.”

In short, the realization of metaphysical freedom is not simply the product of
individual choice. Indeed, the person as a center of volition and knowing is
always already not a pure autonomous center of freedom, but a nurtured product
of heteronomy. We come to awareness, desire, knowledge and love because our
existence is gifted, our development nurtured, our very consciousness as
personal called into being by God and world. Without the world, we would not
even acquire the reflectivity that indirectly shows the soul to itself. This
also implies, I think, that a universal making new is consistent with a proper
notion of the person. It is only those who think salvation along the lines of
an atomized individualism that dissent.

Dr Hart, is there any more where that came from? You’d be doing English
Letters a great service by publishing more of your short fiction. Truly, these
are some of the most exquisitely written, moving stories I’ve ever read.

“When once to a man the human face is the human face divine, and the hand of
his neighbor is the hand of a brother, then will he understand what St. Paul
meant when he said, “I wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren.” But he will no longer understand those who, so far from feeling the
love of their neighbor an essential of their being, expect to be set free from
its law in the world to come. There, at least, for the glory of God, they may
limit its expansive tendencies to the narrow circle of their heaven. On its
battlements of safety, they will regard hell from afar, and say to each other,
“Hark! Listen to their moans. But do not weep, for they are our neighbors no
more.”

The universalist views of Origen and St Gregory Nyssen are well known, but
what about St Maximus the Confessor. Andreapoulos believes that strands of
Maximus’s eschatology intimate an openness to the universalist vision, despite
the damnation passages that can be found in the Maximian corpus. Andreapoulos
points to Maximus’s conviction that every human being will experience an
eschatological healing of his gnomic will. When the Good is fully manifested
in the _parousia_ of Christ, why would anyone reject the Good?

I agree with the effects of seeing God ‘face to face.’ I question, though,
whether all will ever come to such a state. Is it possible to see God ‘face to
face’ if great delusions remain?

But no one denies free will. Everything here is an affirmation of it. It is
the “voluntarist” view of freedom, paradoxically, that would make the will
incapable of freedom. Do you, as a Christian, believe you are free just
because you make choices, or that you are ever freer the better the choices
you make are? Because they correspond to the truth that is God, I mean?
Forgive me, but you simply need to think the matter through with greater
attention to the logic of freedom and the logic of what metaphysical and modal
attributes are entailed in the word “God.” No Church Father ever had a keener
and fuller and more sophisticated understanding of free will than did Gregory
of Nyssa. None was a more adamant and unhesitating universalist. The two
things are not in tension in his thought; they are necessarily logically
implied in one another.

Faced with the lights of the Kingdom of heaven in the night (in itself
hopeless) of hell, we are therefore empowered by faith to throw ourselves
naked into the love of God. As worthy descendants of Abraham—“In hope he
believed against hope” (Rom 4:18)—we hope that the bottomless depths of God’s
fatherhood, of Christ’s Passion, and of the resources of the Holy Spirit will
allow us to escape from the fiery prison that is hell. We can say nothing of
how this might be; but we must trust absolutely in the reserves of love,
grace, and glory, whose only measure is God’s love for the Son in the Holy
Spirit, a love in which we are forever included. Moreover, since God has
revealed to us in his Son that we are saved and saveable by pure grace, and
never by our works (Rom 1–4), how could it be otherwise when the eschatology
of every creature is decided, at the crowning moment when the mystery of
grace, in which we have been established for all time by God himself, will be
fulfilled? In this light, hell becomes, with regard to a boundless faith, the
location of choice for God’s victory over the most incomprehensible
rejection—victory that could be called humanly unexpected and that is for the
prayer of the spiritual and for the thought of the theologian “able to be
hoped for.”

Dear friend,  
I have been enjoying greatly David Bentley Hart’s thinking on this matter. He
is wrestling with this in translating the New Testament, and is coming to some
fascinating conclusions. We spoke of the two words for (eternal) punishment,
with one kolasis-punishment for a time, for correction; and timoria-punishment
of vengeance. Next he noted that there are forty or so passages in the NT
about universal Salvation, and only one meaning eternal punishment. The
strongest adversary is St. Augustine, not working from Greek but Latin, and
his emendations of the language in Romans 5:18 (which in Greek has neither
subject, nor verb, nor object), and I Corinthians 15:22. And, Augustine is
particularly strident in his polemic against Julian, who riled him as no other
did in Augustine’s late age. (Ep. 101, 4). See Augustine’s Contra Jul. 4, and
24.

Whether Universalism is correct or not, isn’t believing in Universalism
inherently dangerous, since you include yourself? Isn’t safe route is to
believe like St. Anthony the Great that “all will be saved, only I will
perish”?

Talbott was asked to write a new essay for the online Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. This article provides a helpful review of recent philosophical
discussion of hell. Talbott does not hide his universalist sympathies. For a
different perspective, see [the article by Jonathan
Kvanvig](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/heaven-hell/) that
Talbott’s piece replaced.

If man was created perfect and free in this way, why did the Fall occur then?
If man (freely and) necessarily chooses good in prelapsarian state, how is the
Fall even possible?

Drawing on Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance, Paschall proposes that universal
salvation appropriately follows from God’s election of humanity in Jesus
Christ.

Guinness it is. My treat. I’m not a fan of beer though. A chilled Pinot Grigio
will do, if David Hart will join.

I might say here that even hopeful inclusivists so far unable to dogmatize
this universal hope are nevertheless obligated by love to hope and pray for
it, to the degree that the supposed alternatives (infernalism, conditional
immortality or annihilationism) are in principle untenable.

What to do? Can we bring your two phrases together in supposing that it is the
very power to interrupt which must embrace God as its end? God saves ‘that’
power, i.e., our will in its God-given power to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. And it
rests when, as a God-given power to interrupt itself, it gives itself to God.
Maybe that’s your position. Sorry if I’ve misunderstood. But that does look
minimally libertarian to me (not a crude claim to a power to self-determine
free from all context and natural constraints).

Yes, I own it, and I agree–it should be on the list. I’ll add it. Thanks.

Thank you for bringing my attention to this book. I’m going to have to borrow
it through ILL.

That the natural will has only one transcendental end is logically necessary.
That is not even debatable because it is written In the very definition of the
will as intentional. Please understand that this is different from saying that
the finite deliberative will or finite mind always wills the truly good as the
Good. You are confusing issues.

Fr Coleman, that is fascinating news! I had heard that Hart had been
commissioned to translate the NT (or the entire Bible?). I hope that Hart will
eventually share with the rest of us the conclusions of his study.

I wanted to be Captain Kirk too, around 1975. L’hommes d’un certain age.

I confess I do press hard, but only to see how much is discoverable; to test-
drive theories. But I’d be happy with the mere affirmation THAT our actions
contribute (in ways that do not reduce to mere secondary causation). If that’s
affirmed, I can tolerate any amount of mystery.

Following Louth’s lead, it seems like early Maximos assigns a gnomic will to
Christ (since, if we have one, Christ must have a gnomic will, lest what is
not assumed is not healed) and then later, denies it (because he sees it as a
dysfunction). But in positing the gnomic will as a ‘third moment,’ you not
only take the conversation a good leap forward, but also open up our
imaginations to revisit Gethsemane, where ‘Not my will, but thine,’ reveals
that third moment in Christ. Non? Oui?

Gavrilyuk offers a helpful introduction to Bulgakov’s eschatology. He is
ultimately critical of Bulgakov’s universalist convictions: he thinks that the
great theologian slides into a metaphysical necessitarianism, just as Origen
did. I disagree. Bulgakov is too concerned to preserve the synergistic freedom
of the creature to allow any kind of necessity to govern his eschatological
convictions.

To be honest, the rhetoric is stirring, but I find the reasoning a little
banal, for the reasons I have already enunciated. And exegetically poor. It
reduces freedom to mere libertarian optionalism (to use some jargon) and God
to an option among options (a thing among things). It is a defense of an
indefensible doctrinal tradition, heroic but hopeless.

How all that sorts out is ultimately a matter of trust and seeing in a mirror
darkly.

If you happen to visit these comments again, I am curious to know your
response to those who claim that the belief in universalism is a heresy since
it was (supposedly) condemned by the fifth ecumenical council.

Dear me, you really think those are interpolations? That is something of a
joke in scholarly circles. Especially since it would basically mean that
Gregory’s whole theology, from the ground up, as unfolded in De anima et
resurrectione and De hominis opificio and the Great Oration and the Psalms
commentary is an interpolation. Maybe Gregory never really wrote anything
(rather like the Oxfordian hyposthesis about Shakespeare). Something similar
is true in Isaac’s case. And those two are far from being the only patristic
universalists; both of the very distinct Alexandrian (including Cappadocian)
and Antiochene tradition are full of them, from the days of Pantaenus to the
13th century writings of Solomon of Bostra. Goodness, there are almost
overwhelming reasons to believe Gregory Nazianzen, and even Athanasius and
Cyril of Alexandria, were so disposed (Gregory unquestionably, really).

Well, honestly, I know of no universalist of the classical variety who
suggests anything other than that purgative regeneration of the will. I am not
sure what the issue is.

I absolutely agree with all you’ve said. I’d love to admire several comments
in particular, but I’ve hogged enough of the convo. So just one quick comment,
on this:

Unlike the Latin Fathers, many of the Eastern Fathers believed that when
Christ descended to hades, he saved all of its inhabitants. This universality
of the Lord’s paschal work is also reflected in the Orthodox Church’s hymnody.
This is one reason why the greater hope simply will not go away in Orthodoxy.

This book contains most, though not all, of my articles (now revised) on
universal salvation. Enjoy!

If human beings are made by God and for God, if the Holy Trinity is their
ultimate Good, only in whom they may find the happiness they desire toward
whom their consciousness is teleologically directed, then we may not entertain
the possibility that they could irrevocably close themselves off to Love.
God’s salvific will cannot be eternally stymied. _That All Shall Be Saved_ has
brought apokatastasis back to the catholic table. See my series which seeks to
explicate Hart’s arguments: “[Apprehending
Apokatastasis](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/apprehending-
apokatastasis-the-incoherence-of-everlasting-perdition/).”

To our list of Orthodox universalist authors, I would like to add Fr.
Alexandre Turnicev, who wrote Alexandre Turincev (1966) “Une approche de
l’eschatologie orthodoxe,” Contacts 18, no. 54. The article also appeared in
part in Olivier Clément, ‘Dieu est Vivant: catéchisme pour les familles par
une équipe de Chrétiens Orthodoxes’ (Editions du Cerf, 1979), which was the
original French edition of ‘The Living God: A Catechism for the Christian
Faith’, 2 Vols. Trans. by Olga  
Dunlop (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1988) but that chapter was omitted in
the English  
translation. So Father Michael Gillis and the monks from Holy Transfiguration
Hermitage (Gibsons, BC Canada) helped me translate it into English. You can
see it in the Canadian Journal of Orthodox Christianity here:

Hi, Brad. Welcome to Eclectic Orthodoxy. I have your book sitting on my shelf,
but I haven’t read it yet. One of these days … 🙂

My wife and I will be moving there in September for her postdoc. I’ve
contacted the local Orthodox parish here in Doha (and the Archbishop in a
chance encounter; he deflected my inquiry) in order to begin conversion to
Orthodoxy, but it has been of no avail. Anyway, my wife and I will be
travelling throughout the region and coordinating our move back to the States
this summer so I will unfortunately not be able to begin the initiation (that
is, if it resembles the duration of RCIA) until we’re settled in Princeton. In
light of Fr. John discouraging universal salvation, I’m hesitant to explain to
an unsympathetic priest that it is largely St. Isaac’s writings on the
atonement and our ultimate reconciliation with God that has drawn me to the
Church. Can you recommend a parish in Princeton where that will not
automatically exclude me from entering the Church?

Before a person can seriously entertain the universalist hope, he must become
per­suaded that the the Father of Jesus Christ loves sinners absolutely,
uncondi­tion­ally, nontransactionally. I can think of no better theologian to
assist us in grasping this truth than Robert Capon—not because Capon is a
theologian of the first-rank (he doesn’t even belong to the second-rank), but
because he has an uncanny ability to think outside the conditionalist box.
Such an ability is necessary when interpreting the New Testament as
eschatological discourse. Capon also has a whimsical writing style that often
makes me chuckle (and sometimes cringe).

Greetings, Stanford. Thanks for the suggestion about Dame Julian. I
intentionally omitted her from my list because I have come across two Julian
scholars who deny her universalism. Most recently, see Denys Turner’s book
[_Julian of Norwich,
Theologian_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030019255X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=030019255X&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20).
I tend to trust Turner’s judgment–hence my reluctance to include Julian in my
list. What do you think?

Andreas Andreapoulos, “[Eschatology and final restoration (apokatastasis) in
Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and Maximos the
Confessor](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/andropoulos-on-
apokatastasis-in-origen-gregory-of-nyssa-and-maximus-the-confessor.pdf)”

There is no verse in the New Testament that unambiguously threatens eternal
punishment. There are three that are regularly invoked by the Hellfire Club
(my fond name for those who have some emotional commitment to the idea of a
hell of eternal torment), but none of them really says what they imagine it
says. Conversely, the seemingly very clear statements of universal salvation
number quite high (47 at my last casual count).

“But it is a wild question. God is, and shall be, All in all. Father of our
brothers and sisters! You will not be less glorious than we, taught of Christ,
are able to think You. When You go into the wilderness and seek, You will not
come home until you have found. It is because we hope not for them in You, not
knowing Your love, that we are so hard and so heartless to the brothers and
sisters You have given us.”

Kronen & Reitan analyze the philosophical case for annihilationism in light of
the arguments advanced in their book. Bottomline: annihilationism suffers from
many of the same flaws as does infernalism.

Patristic Universalism: An Alternative to the Traditional View of Divine
Judgment by David Burnfield

The New Testament only seems to clearly teach eternal damnation if it is read
through a hermeneutic of perdition. Its witness looks very different when read
through the paschal victory of Jesus Christ.

Thanks for this list Fr. Aidan. I am firmly into the concept that Met. Ware
has expressed. I hope for the salvation of all mankind. However, I believe
that Satan and the demons have already been judged and condemned to
annihilation in the Lake of Fire which is prepared for them. God has waited to
carry out their execution because he wants to save all humanity if possible.
The Church Fathers who believed that Satan and the demons would be saved have
no basis in Holy Scripture and the acts of Satan and the demons to base their
teaching on. Where there is no repentance, there is not life.

Hi, Eric. For my own thoughts about the Fifth Ecumenical Council, see “[The
Heresy That Never Was](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/apocatastasis-
the-heresy-that-never-was/).”

Honestly, what you describe expresses where I’m at (though my questions might
suggest otherwise). As you say, “True freedom as the perfected flourishing of
one’s being is an eschatological fruition that can be anticipated insofar as
one’s actions bring one closer to the unique gift of one’s being/vocation
granted by the creator God.” No objection here. I’m perfectly happy viewing
“freedom” as you describe and for the reasons you give.

The Apostle Peter teaches that after his death, the Lord descended into hades
and preached the good news to the departed. In her hymnody the Eastern Church
sings that the result of this harrowing was the rescue of all.

Seriously, though, when Brian writes: “I maintain that the original gift of
being involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some
level, but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream,
play, wonder, creativity and loving encounter,” it is rather as if I am
reading someone else laying out my own sensibility. But I think there is a
deep theological insight here that is too easily ignored as something vague,
gauzy, or sentimental, because we are all so prone to thinking in the rather
arid categories of (for want of a better word) analytic correspondence that we
regard the entire tacit dimension of knowledge (which is the foundation of all
knowledge) as somehow either merely inchoate or merely emotional. If one is
not careful, one ends up with the barren dialectic of “rationalism” or
“fideism,” and one ends up like a certain popular Thomist I know of, unable to
think in any other terms than that.

  35. Pingback: [Be wrong in good conscience, and by that you shall be saved. | Rustbelt Orthodoxy](http://www.rustbeltpriest.org/?p=317)

I must confess, it’s the only one I’ve yet to read. Perhaps I should fear for
my soul.

“Simply said, all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will
reach that end, and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption
prevents them; but rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still,
willy-nilly, all natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as
bliss or torment, but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot
not convert the will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will
never be all in all and creation will never be completed. That teleological
understanding of the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be
forced into the categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I
honestly wish Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories
for that reason.”

Umm, well, not in earnest, you know. But, in retrospect, it might be my
favorite in the collection.

And do you believe he really believed he was headed for eternal perdition? It
is a wonderful statement of humility and hope, not a prophecy.

But let’s not pursue the issue. Be wrong in good conscience, and by that you
shall be saved.

It is often not noticed that a significant doctrinal correction has occurred
in Christian theology. For 1500 years hell has been thought as everlasting
retributive punishment. This is no longer the case. Over the past 75 years
Western philosophers and theologians have rejected the punitive model of hell
and have proposed what is a free-will model. Quite independently, Orthodox
theologians have advanced the “river of fire” model. Universal salvation is
but the logical conclusion of the free-will and river of fire models. God is
love, and he will not be satisfied until all have been converted to him in
love.

First, note that what is being rejected in those two anathemas is not
universalism. The first rejects pre-existence of souls without bodies, in a
primal and undifferentiated community of monads. The second rejects an
ultimate disappearance both of bodies and of individual identity in a unity
rather of the sort asserted by bar Sudhaili, where gnosis (the single shared
knowledge of God and souls) is indistinguishable from the hypostasis (the
substance) of souls. Neither was a teaching of Origen’s, actually (Origen
taught pre-existence, but not actual bodilessness).

Oh, I should have noted: the first anathema of “Origen” is clearly phrased:
what is rejected is a restoration whose premise is the pre-existent state of
souls, such that all things must return to the original state, without
personal or natural differentiation of souls. That is why it speaks of the
restoration “that follows from” or is “consequent upon” that pre-existence. I
think we often fail to appreciate that, even as late as the fifth council,
there were still too many of the “holy fathers” and too many participants in
the council who, at least sub rosa reservationis, held to an eventual
salvation of all for an outright and unambiguous condemnation of universal
salvation to have been possible.

In simple terms, if a deranged man chooses to slash himself with a knife or
set fire to himself, you would not be interfering with his “freedom” by
preventing him from doing so. You would be rescuing him from his slavery to
madness. This is why the free-will defense of the idea of an eternal hell is
essentially gibberish.

Totally agree with DBH’s point that our truest freedom is a will at rest in
God as its telos—where God is desired and intended in all things. And of
course I’d agree that wrestling someone to the ground who intends to set
themselves afire is not an intervention in their freedom.

– On the one hand, “rational nature is capable of interrupting itself” of
preventing its movement toward its natural end in God.

For a philosophical argument based on a libertarian understanding of free
will, see “[What Are the
Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-salvation-what-are-
the-odds/)”

The relation of divine providence and divine foreknowledge is a difficult,
perhaps intractable, problem, especially for classical theists but also for
modern theists who desire to remain within the mainstream Christian tradition.
This is not an easy piece, but it does shed light and is well worth the read.
At the very least it demonstrates how difficult it is to reconcile eternal
damnation with a God who is benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.

Nemes argues that despite the passages in the New Testament that threaten
eternal damnation, we do not in fact know whether hell will be eternally
populated. Hence we may confidently pray for the salvation of all.

But also, and perhaps a bigger misunderstanding for me, is, isn’t universalism
deterministic, does it not require one to be mongerstic, where does free
agency come in, if we can boldly say that all WILL be saved, rather than
reserving judgment and saying all MAY be saved, for if even only one is
allowed his freedom and chooses to shrink away from the humanity and divinity
he was created for, in essence, in hell, moving in the opposite direction of
theosis. Would this not then render universalism false? This of course
presupposing synergism, whereas if we say all WILL be, then are we not
mongerist? Is it not simple the moral form of determinism?

On p. 320, with reference to Michel de Certeau’s “Authorités Chrétiennes et
Structures Sociales,” you concede the possibility that in our final fulfilled
form Christ offers (in Certeau’s words) “a style of existence that ‘allows’
for a certain kind of creativity and that opens a new series of experiences”
as opposed to, say, Christ specifying every particular of our continuing
existence without remainder (even if, as you say, Christ comprises the
fullness of every contingent expression).

DeRose asks the free-will defenders of hell: if God cannot save all, why at
least does he not save more than he does? DeRose distinguishes himself from
David Hart in that he cannot affirm that all, without exception, will
indubitably be saved; but he thinks it very, very, very likely.

With reference to C. S. Lewis’s _The Great Divorce_ , I reflect on the
possibility of heavenly happiness when one knows that one or more loved ones
are suffering everlasting torment.

I am convinced that this wonderful truth is knocking on the door of Christ’s
church and that we’re on the verge of a reformation of grace that will
ultimately eclipse the one introduced by Martin Luther. Consequently, I have
written and published a book, Dropping Hell and Embracing Grace, by Ivan A.
Rogers, available from Amazon.com, also on Kindle. The book has been well-
received; a welcome addition to the exciting discussion of universalism.

Andrew Louth is a patristic scholar and one of the foremost Orthodox
theologians in the world. Louth grounds Orthodox reflection on the Last Things
in the Divine Liturgy. Louth notes that “in Orthodox theology a hope of
universal salvation, based on a conviction of the boundlessness of God’s love,
has never gone away.”

For almost a millennia the Latin Church has taught that at the moment of death
the eternal destiny of the individual is definitively and irrevocably settled.
This doctrine is known as the [particular
judgment](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm). But the Eastern Church
has retained the older belief that the destiny of the damned is not settled
until the final judgment. Until then, salvation is still possible through the
prayers of the Church for the departed.

Somewhere in my library I have a mid-19thC volume of interest: “The Ancient
History of Universalism”, by Hosea Ballou. Ballou was a consistent Calvinist
who came to modify his position by a belief in universal election, and went on
to found the Universalist Church, which, regrettably developed to an extreme
liberalism and has merged with the Unitarians. His book is interesting, adding
to a Scriptural exposition a surprising knowledge of patristics. I’ve read it
through more than once, and find myself not convinced of universalism as a
doctrine. I don’t think we can go that far. But it did leave me ready to hold
a universalist hope similar to many of those you quote.

In modern times some Orthodox have begun to claim that all local synods and
councils are doctrinal authoritative and so Orthodoxy has just as many exact
doctrinal formulae as Rome. Call it magisterium-envy. But in fact the ancient
canonical view is that only an ecumenical council can ratify a synod as
doctrinally binding. And it’s been a while, you know.

But I don’t want to be understood as suggesting that epistemic distance in
hell is just this world’s context reconstructed in which we comfortably
continue to pursue our careers. I think if we take the sufferings of hell to
be commensurate with “will’s” depth of solidification in evil and our coming
to terms with this, then we don’t have to affirm UR at the expense of free
agency. That is, if the ‘will’ has a share (by either persisting in its ‘no’
and thus suffering OR embracing the truth of its history with a ‘yes’) in the
uncovering of the truth about God and ourselves that steadily renders our
saying ‘no’ to God finally impossible, then I’m OK with that. That is, hell
confronts us, truth by truth, with our whole history which we are free to
accept or reject. And the death of every false self will be unspeakable
torment as we are left to experience the truth of our choices. Ouch. But as we
choose to embrace the truth, we become more free. Eventually we are wholly and
completely God’s. And the journey from one to the other will be the journey
from experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as torment to
experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as beatitude. The
difference between heaven and hell isn’t geography, it’s perspective. The
truth that once tormented us becomes the truth that glorifies us.

Belt is not a patristic scholar and certainly not an expert on St Maximus (who
is?), but he is a thoughtful reader and theologian. In this article he
reflects on Maximus’s _Ambiguum_ 7 and wonders whether Maximus’ metaphysics
and understanding of God logically leads to universal salvation, even if the
great Church Father never connected the dots.

Nemes critically analyzes two classical objections against the universalist
hope, one from the Augustianian-Reformed tradition and the other from the
Arminian-Wesleyan tradition: (1) The divine goodness does not require that God
save anyone. (2) If human beings are genuinely free, then they must be able to
eternally and irrevocably reject God and thus separate themselves from his
love and mercy.

But I would still say that the final formulation about epistemic ignorance is
defective. Taken to its logical terminus it would mean that we are free to the
degree that we are ignorant, whereas the point is that we become more free as
we progress away from illusion towards the Good as such and the fulfillment of
our nature. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Father,
forgive them, they know not what they do. Etc. And the highest freedom is
achieved when we at last see so clearly that there is no need for choice,
because union in love has been reached.

Bulgakov was perhaps the most creative, daring, profound—and also most
contro­versial—Orthodox theologian of the 20th century. Those of us who are
unacquainted with Russian philosophy, as I am, will probably find this a
difficult book to read; yet it is illuminating in ways that most works of
theology are not. Bulgakov’s mind and heart were alive with the Holy Spirit.
He was a true priest and theologian of the Church.

Resistance was futile. I’ve just been compelled (in Borg-like fashion) to
purchase the Devil and Pierre. 3 pages in … Screwtape on crack?

Discussion of the 5th Ecumenical Council is scattered throughout the blog, but
see especially my comments in [this
interview](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/an-interview-with-fr-
aidan-kimel/). Short answer: (1) it is doubtful that the council itself
dogmatized on the matter, and (2) the version of apokatastasis addressed by
the anti-Origenist anathemas (whatever their dogmatic status may be) touches
the universalist hope as presented by, say, St Gregory of Nyssa or St Isaac of
Nineveh.

Now I may be very wrong in my attempts to speak of what Austin Farrer calls
“double agency,” but it is also very wrong to call it heresy. The Orthodox
Church hasn’t even considered this difficult question at the depth it needs to
be considered before any such judgment can be made. But let’s assume the
libertarians are right. We can still proclaim the universalist hope: see
“[What are the Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-
salvation-what-are-the-odds/)” Hope this helps.

        * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce73fb23a9bdd58d820b45b0c9bf660b?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) Fr Aidan Kimel says:

If I have questions, they are not about “freedom” as you’ve described it. They
are about the nature of the words “insofar as one’s actions bring one closer
to….” Is there not a conversation to be had here, i.e., about what sort of
agency or action it is which is the means by which we are to become free?
That’s what I’ve been inquiring after, and it’s only with respect to this that
I’d cautiously employ a term like “libertarian”; not to describe a proper
final mode or resting place for the will, but only to understand the nature of
the agency or action by which means we become free (and thus free of
‘libertarian’ becoming).

– On the other hand, that nature “cannot not convert…to its true end.”

Transformation in the eschaton necessarily exceeds our imaginative capacities.
I have no doubt synergy is involved. No one will be coerced into beatitude.
Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to me that what you may really be after is a
deeper reflection upon the connection between our temporal becoming and
eternal identity. You won’t be able to shoehorn that into a clear and concise
conceptualization. Poets may elucidate a suggestive image. I suspect art, at
any rate, while it must fail as well, will probably fail less than the
language of concepts.

Human beings are not created in a neutral state _vis-à-vis_ their Creator.
They are created with a natural desire for union with him.

I am far more conscious of the many people who have apostasized of any form of
traditional Christian faith or who despair of God’s help because of the
unnuanced preaching of everlasting damnation coupled with the awareness, in
this age of mass media, of all the evil and suffering perpetrated in the world
(a lot of it these days in the name of superior fidelity to the supreme
“God”!) than I do any Christians who do not take the working out of their
salvation seriously because of a cavalier universalist hope in the scope of
Christ’s defeat of the powers of hell. I am blessedly reminded by St.
Silouan’s words here of Christ’s parable of the Lost Sheep, how for the sake
of the one lost, the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 in the fold to go seeking the
one that remains lost. . . . This alone gives hope to my breaking heart. It is
only when I dare to hope that the Lord might really be this relentless and
victorious in His love, that I feel sin begin to loosen its grip on me.

Right. There’s no value in ignorance per se. I’m only suggesting that the
‘becoming’ of human beings toward their final telos in God be characterized by
choosing which is a choice between alternatives, and not a single inevitable
choice given to them by God (which, I confess, is how I read some construals
of universalism). Does that help at all?

This is a classic in Roman Catholic literature on the subject. Here we see the
decisive break in post-Vatican II Catholicism from retributivist models of
both purgatory and hell.

Jordan Wood, “[The Remarkable Unity of Rhetoric and Dialectic in _That All
Shall Be Saved_](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/the-remarkable-
unity-of-rhetoric-and-dialectic-in-david-harts-that-all-shall-be-saved/)”

As for how the fall occurred, no theologian has ever given a satisfactory
theory. But that word “perfect” is misplaced. By definition, nothing temporal
is “perfect” in its origin (unless by origin one means the divine intention
for that being).

David, may I ask for your thoughts about the dogmatic authority with Orthodoxy
of the [Synodikon](https://sites.google.com/site/thetaboriclight/synodikon).
It is sometimes invoked as a decisive authority against the universalist hope.
This anathema in particular is cited:

I don’t know if this analogy will help, but I think modern, voluntarist
notions of freedom are akin to the way scientism approaches the existence of
reality. Scientism never really asks the question of why there is something
rather than nothing. It can’t understand that an infinite series of finite
causes still can’t address origins — or even feel the need for such,
apparently. Similarly, voluntarism is fixated on finite, concrete situations
and never sees that the source of freedom is prior and other.

Simply said, if it isn’t one of the promulgations of the seven councils, then
it’s nothing but the record of how certain clergymen at a certain time and
place understood the tradition (usually over against those blasted monks). And
then there is the question of what certain councils–the 5th of course–really
said.

On reflection, I think the first. However, I think that the first statement is
kind of a given, even in St. Anthony’s statement. It’s not that God will not
find a way to turn our heart to him, but that we don’t accept his invitation.

Brad, I presume that “holy monk of Mt. Athos” who is quoted is St. Silouan?
Thanks. I needed to read that after reading Fr. John’s posts on this subject.
It is that precise agony of prayer in my own experience, a deep grief that any
should miss Christ and be lost, that I believe prompted the Lord in His mercy
to open my eyes to the Orthodox Church. Without at least a hope that all might
be saved–without a genuinely Orthodox Paschal vision–I don’t see how I would
be able to go on getting up again after I fall down in my walk with Christ. I
live in dread that Fr. John’s interpretation of the Tradition of the Church
might be correct. This fallen world is already more a hell to me than I can
handle–watching cultures coarsen, crash and burn, knowing how people suffer
and being mostly powerless to help any of them. St. Silouan’s vision is the
prayer that keeps me going.

OK with all that said…. Which authors or theologians in your reading have you
come across that would agree or created this thought? Thank you so much for
your help!

Section III of _Bride of the Lamb_ is devoted to the topic of eschatology.
This section can be read to great benefit just by itself. Bulgakov’s
universalism is neither sentimental nor trite. He does not envision salvation
apart from repentance and ascetical sacrifice. We should fear hell and its
torment, but we should trust God more. “The torments of hell are a longing for
God caused by the love of God,” he states. It is blasphemy to think that evil
will triumph over the the risen Lord. Bulgakov emphatically rejects any
violation of the human person. No one can or should be coerced into the
kingdom. The divine judgment is nothing less than the full revelation of the
Christ, in whose image every human being is made: “Every human being sees
himself in Christ and measures the extent of his difference from this proto-
image. A human being cannot fail to love the Christ who is revealed in him,
and he cannot fail to love himself revealed in Christ.” (See Roberto de la
Noval’s article on Bulgakov, listed below.)

The One Purpose of God: An Answer to the Doctrine of Eternal Punishment by Jan
Bonda

Jersak surveys the hymns of the Orthodox liturgies and offers this conclusion:
“Our kontakia and troparia, our typika and canons, are a continuous bold
declaration that what Christ accomplished through the Cross, his conquest into
hades and his glorious resurrection, was for all humanity, affects all
humanity and calls all humanity. They comprise the gospel announcement that
Christ is victorious over death and has raised up humanity with himself.”

I am convinced that a failure of imagination partly underlies the resistance
to the greater hope. If a person dies hating and rejecting God, how can God
possibly deliver him or her from that rejection? The medicinal understanding
of purgatory comes to the rescue. That there is a hell for the impenitent, all
universalists affirm. But it is not an everlasting punishment but the painful
redemptive process by which the risen Christ liberates us from our delusions
and addictions and brings us to clear vision of that Love for which each of us
desires.

My blog has become somewhat “infamous” for its promulgation of the
universalist hope. You may find of interest my series on **[St Isaac the
Syrian](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/st-isaac-the-syrian-the-
triumph-of-the-kingdom-over-gehenna/)** and **[Sergius
Bulgakov](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/sergius-bulgakov-the-
irresistible-truth-of-final-judgment/)**. They aren’t scholarly pieces. If you
have a chance to glance at them, I’d welcome your feedback.

This may be the first book I would recommend to someone who desires to explore
the biblical basis for the universalist hope. Written for a popular audience,
Jersak invites his readers to bracket their dogmatic systems and listen to the
Scriptures afresh, in all of their irreducible diversity and complexity. “Our
obsessive attempts,” he writes, “to harmonize the Scriptures into artificially
coherent, stackable propositions—as if they required us to contend for their
reliability or authority—actually do violence to their richness.” One finds
within the Bible specific texts that may be reasonably interpreted to support
each of the three major construals of eschatological destiny—infernalist,
annihilationist, and universalist. Perhaps we need to hear all three voices.

Oh, by the way, Capon was not a universalist. He believes that it is possible
for the sinner, like the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son, to
stand outside the festivities of the kingdom. Like C. S. Lewis, Capon
advocates a free-will model of damnation. Might it be possible for the damned
to repent of their rejection of the divine mercy? Perhaps. All moments in time
are eternally held within the spear wound of Christ and thus eternally
available to the damned for their exploration and reassessment.

And, had our our Lord spoken of everlasting punishment, that would be an
interesting argument. But he did not speak English, and in fact did not speak
Greek; and the Greek text of Matthew 25:46 (which is the only one you can have
in mind) has been read by a great many Greek-speaking and Syriac-speaking
fathers, from the earliest days, as saying nothing of the sort.

If you are looking for a philosophically sophisticated defense of the
universalist hope, this is the book for you. Kronen and Reitan are both
trained philosophers. They are well acquainted with the philosophical
literature on universalism, as well as with the scholastic tradition. They
critically analyze the classical and modern doctrines of hell, present the
arguments they deem most convincing in support of universal salvation, and
respond to various objections. Anyone who wants to argue against universalism
first needs to read _God’s Final Victory_ and address its arguments.

If you consult the (very dubious) records of the council, you will find
something called Origenism condemned. But no authentic finding of the council
condemns universalism as such.

Fear not. Fr John is wrong–absolutely and lamentably wrong. God actually is
better than we, not the contemptible tyrant of the servile religious
imagination. Read Isaac. Read George MacDonald’s Unspoken Sermons, the finest
works of theology in the English language.

Lastly, let me say in case I don’t get another chance, I have really benefited
from your writing and lectures. Particularly, I really enjoyed your article on
baseball. But, more seriously, I’ve been working through Beauty of the
Infinite and being challenged throughout. So thank you, and I pray you’ll be
afforded the health to continue writing.

The figure of Judas Iscariot has long captured the imagination of Christians,
even begetting poems and songs. Hart reflects on one forgotten poem by a
forgotten English poet, Robert Buchanan. If Jesus is love, is he not awaiting
the return of his friend and disciple at the messianic banquet?

Standing under the judgment of the Cross (and bound by Catholic dogma), we may
not assert apokatastasis, says Balthasar; but we may—and indeed must—pray for
the salvation of all. Universal restoration in Christ is a possibility for
which we may hope, but can never be a certainty we may proclaim.

I have not read this book yet, but Tom Belt assures us that it is an excellent
primer on the topic of universal salvation. See [Tom’s EO
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/grace-saves-all-a-book-
review/).

To definitively reject God is to choose the nothingness of evil. Some thoughts
on the free-will defense of hell, with special reference to Jonathan Kvanvig
and Eleonore Stump.

Now, if God were to say, “My dear Yaakov, no matter what you do or desire,
even against your strongest wish, I will turn your heart to me” – then I’d say
that statement would be more of a turn off than “only you will perish and
there’s nothing I can do to save you”.

Both “never” and “forever” are awfully big words. Could a finite and imperfect
being be envisioned as having the constancy to refuse through an infinity of
time? Scripture seems to describe the sinful man as wavering. I shortcircuits
my thinking to try to posit such an infinite and firmly consistent refusal on
the part of a finite, flawed, and inconstant being such as we all are.

That is obscure. Sorry. But, yes, I prefer to think that, healed, it remains,
and that it makes each soul’s reflection of and participation in divine beauty
a unique inflection or modulation of the whole. Which makes each individual
indispensable, of course, to that glory.

Church During Its First Five Hundred
Years](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NOMYCW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eclectorthod-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B008NOMYCW&linkId=9c87d90275c1e730f32aa490532c3466)_

The question of everlasting damnation does not possess the status of
infallibility because it directly contradicts the revealed truth of divine
love and goodness and the “happy ending” promised by the gospel of Jesus
Christ.

In replying above to my inquiry about human agency (framed in terms of the
concerns at play between determinists and indeterminists/libertarians), you
replied:

Balthasar did not convert me to the universalist hope. The seeds for that hope
were planted back in the early 80s when Thomas Torrance and Robert Jenson
taught me the unconditionality of the divine love. But Balthasar watered those
seeds. Faith in the absolute love of God slowly began to grow into hope for a
universalist Future. Eventually, though, I realized that I needed to proclaim
a more confident, greater hope than Balthasar allows.

I’m not a trained philosopher (which you know by now), and if the Analytic
tradition inherently violates some law of transcendence, then OK. Obviously
that tradition has been employed to deny transcendence. But analytic thinkers
can employ the standard categories to affirm transcendence as well, no? (Denys
Turner perhaps?) But, as far your comments in the quote go, it looks to me
like you employ the categories you want equally to dismiss—i.e., all things
are “determined” to a “final cause,” “rational nature” can interrupt itself,
and “teleology” drives the process. Are not these terms standard analytic-
talk?

It used to trouble me, as a young aspiring student of Asian religions, that
the typical way in which the work of Christ was preached from pulpits made it
seem not only that our God is morally inferior to the bodhisattva, but that in
fact Christianity was burdened by a thwarted moral imagination, and that the
Mahayana made this obvious. Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald and Isaac of
Ninevah (etc.) prevented me from abandoning the faith as an ungainly alloy of
the ennobling and the barbaric.

Good points too. I certainly don’t want to boil theosis down to an exchange of
bits of information. So I’ll work on fine-tuning the distinction I’m aiming at
here. My gut tells me there’s a legit (liceitous? Adjective please?) concern
about created agency here (that it not be overwhelmed unto determinism). But
as I’m reading you, you’re not simply positing in a postmortem context the
kind of, say, compatibilist determination of human choice you reject
presently, supposing that God resorts to perfecting human beings postmortem in
a fundamentally different way than at present.

However, it does seem to me that God’s dealings with us (postmortem) cannot
reduce to his simply overwhelming us with truth to the degree that our saying
“no” to God is rendered impossible. So while it’s true that no choice made in
ignorance can be ‘free’ in the fullest sense, it’s also true that the sort of
‘becoming’ that moves us into participation in God can only be made within a
context of the right kind of epistemic distance (i.e., a context in which we
both know enough to choose rightly and are ignorant enough to manufacture a
false narrative in choosing wrongly—that this ‘distance’ defines the synergy
we value). But if epistemic distance is reduced to zero, does not synergy
reduce to determinism? I am inclined to universalism, but I think configuring
the human response to God in a way that guarantees it will be ‘yes’ is
problematic. So I tend just to say that God will pursue us as long as it takes
without positing a _terminus ad quem_.

A collection of essays discussing the universalist hope articulated by various
theologians in the history of the Church, from Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa
to Sergius Bulgakov, and Karl Barth. Tom Talbott’s piece on George MacDonald
is of particular interest. A helpful and instructive volume.

You mentioned the toll houses, a curious bit of semi-gnostic bric-a-brac. Fr
John might be interested to know that many monks who embraced that teaching
did so because they were universalists.

Unfortunately, we lack an in-depth treatment of patristic eschatology
available in English. Perhaps such a work would be too much for any single
scholar; or perhaps someone has written such a volume, and it just hasn’t been
translated. Fortunately, we do have Brian Daley’s “handbook,” as he calls it.
Published in 2002, it remains the go-to book on the eschatological views of
the Church Fathers. It does need to be updated, though, in light of the recent
scholarly contributions of Ilaria Ramelli.

Justification by faith proclaims the utter freeness of the grace of God,
gratuitously bestowed on all through the preaching of the good news of Jesus
Christ. Apokatastasis is but the gospel of Christ’s absolute and unconditional
love sung in an eschatological key.

Fr. Aiden, if I might also include this beautiful quote from Catholic
theologian, Gustave Martelet, at the end of his article on hell in the ECT:

This 3-article series represents a recently revised and expanded blog version
of the above Cardiff lecture. How does apokatastasis shape and inform our
preaching of the gospel? How does it fit in with the Orthodox understanding of
Church as manifestation of the Kingdom?

The greater hope is ultimately grounded in a vision of God as absolute,
unconditional Love. If this vision is true, then the doctrine of everlasting
damnation becomes both incomprehensible and morally intolerable.

“Grigio” is a euphemism for “blush.” I’m a noir man all the way, if it’s good.

Wonderful article and comments. Mr Hart, I’ve ordered your book. One thing I’d
like to add: the idea of ignorance vs knowledge, the force of the final [or
not] ‘No’: this is not always or only ignorance, but pathology. No one
violates free will by healing; the Gospel accounts of, eg, the demoniacs or
paralytics stand for this principle. If a man be healed of the
mental/spiritual pathology that lead him to ‘no’, surely he will say Yes. This
avoids the trap of loss of epistemic distance, I think, because you can posit
resistance to everything except the final force majeure.

Yes, you, John Milbank, William Desmond.  
When I’m in the mood for a little light reading . . .

Dale directed me here to see if his recollections of our conversations were
accurate. They are not quite…

I am not really wrestling with the text, at least not in a moral or
intellectual or existential sense. My only struggles are finding the _mot
juste_ (so to speak). I am, and have never concealed that I am, a complete and
unreserved universalist, and believe no other interpretation of Paul’s
theology is coherent. Geoffrey Wainwright’s review of my first book noted it,
for instance. Gregory of Nyssa, after all, succeeded where Augustine failed:
his eschatology incorporates the whole of the New Testament witness (sans
Revelation, which he did not regard as canonical) in a seamless synthesis,
without truncation, equivocation, or attempts to explain away the plain
meaning of crucial texts.

I thought the same thing about the entirety of “A Voice from the Emerald
World.” Surely you were a fan?

Will read that sermon between chapters of the Devil and Pierre! I like the
subtle threat of hell to those alone who would use it to terrorize — no need
for iron in paradise — the kind of rhetorical reversal we see in Christ’s
parables.

The question is based on an ontological confusion, and a naive
anthropomorphism. Sorry to sound arch, but you are not thinking of God as God.
Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot
simply turn away towards “something else.” He is the ground and end of all
desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not
choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire
anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good
and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual
appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee
God, you are desiring God as the “good end” you seek in godlessness. He is
inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are
God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but
an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural
will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don’t think of God as a candidate in
a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the
original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages,
since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will
is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an
object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.

Having read your series, it seems like St. Isaac believes in pre-destination.
I wonder how he would have reacted to the conversation between Ivan and
Alyosha in Brothers K?

Dr Parry’s contribution to this volume is one of the single best introductions
to universal salvation. Highly recommended.

And tonight I read the parallel passage in MacDonald’s sermon, “Love your
neighbor,” that DBH referred us to. It sounds so similar to your heart and got
me thinking, too, that if Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and
FOREVER, then the parable of the lost sheep is a potent universalist passage!
So MacDonald:

Finally! In this affordable volume Ramelli distills her years of research on
apokatastasis in the first- and early second-millennium into an accessible
format. During the first six centuries, the greater hope was alive and well in
many quarters of the Church. Must-buy, must-read.

This discussion should go down in the annals of the blogosphere as the most
intellectually complex discussion ever to be pursued in the commentary section
of a blog. Thank you all very much!  
Unfortunately, I don’t have sufficient knowledge to participate in the
discussion. That is, I am too ignorant or, as most of you would probably put
it, I am too much lacking freedom.  
But perhaps that’s just because I’m catholic…

Have you come across “All Shall Be Well – Explorations in Universal Salvation
and Christian Theology from Origen to Moltmann” edited by (you-know-who)
Gregory MacDonald?  
Among others it contains Origen (obviously), Schleiermacher, P. T. Forsyth,
Barth, Ellul, T  
Robinson, Balthasar and Moltmann. It is an excellent addition to your already
excellent list.

Thanks for the response, Mr. Hart. I do think it’s a helpful clarification
about God, and I think I agree with your basic description of God as man’s
final end.

“Rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in a
kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny.”

Are you sure that you’re not my secret Doppelgaenger, and that soon I’m going
to wake up and realize I’m not I at all but someone you dreamed (in a
Guinness-induced delirium)? I’m pleased you had the wisdom to avoid the
academic world once you got doctored, but I would like to know what you do,
where you are, and whether you write anywhere. And, if not, there’s a journal
I’m associated with…

DBH: Sophrony replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell,
Christ will remain there with him.”

From what I have read, I personally would not describe either [St
Silouan](http://www.bogoslov.ru/en/text/2314168.html) or Elder Sophrony as
explicit universalists; rather, they appear to leave open the possibility of
universal salvation.

Let me try to clarify. Let’s reserve ‘freedom’ for that mode of human agency
fulfilled and glorified in God, our truest freedom in Christ. Let ‘agency’
describe that mode of the will en route to such freedom. I’m suggesting only
that the latter be characterized by a certain epistemic distance/space and
that this distance serves a good purpose, namely, it’s an essential part of
what makes it possible for finite created beings such as ourselves to come to
be free (in the former sense) in God. So ‘freedom’ is the result of a
particular exercise of an ‘agency’ that is sufficiently informed but not
overwhelmed as such.

David, I had heard from Addison that you have been quite ill. May the Lord
grant you a speedy recovery–and if not a _speedy_ recovery, then at least a
_full_ recovery.

Gregory MacDonald is the pseudonym for Robin Parry, who has a Ph.D. in Old
Testament studies. Parry looks at the primary New Testament texts that are
typically invoked in the eternal hell vs. universalism debate. You may be
surprised by how well the new Testament reads when liberated from a prior
dogmatic commitment to the classical doctrine of hell. Parry’s exegesis is
thoughtful, careful, and imaginative. He does not claim more for his
interpretation of a given text than it can bear; but he does invite us to a
fresh re-reading of the Bible through a hermeneutic of love.

If I was only allowed to recommend one book on universalism, this is probably
the one I would choose. Talbott writes clearly and well, and he is sharp as a
tack. The book is intended for a primarily evangelical-Protestant audience.
Orthodox and Catholics will be put off by some of his ecclesiological
convictions; but it’s easy enough to bracket them and simply focus on his
biblical, theological, and philosophical arguments. Talbott has a keen eye for
nonsense. He addresses the biblical testimony head-on. Of particular
importance are the chapters are those in which Talbott discusses human freedom
and the nature of justice. The chapter on predestination is particularly
illuminating.

A bit of Ratzinger ( _Eschatology_ , pp. 215ff.) to add to the discussion:

‘Divine’ agency can’t be reduced to the traditional terms (determinism,
libertarianism, etc.), but do we need to (indeed, can we?) step altogether
outside these categories to imagine ‘human’ transformation or to agree both
that we possess a God-given power to “interrupt” (to say ‘no’ to) our movement
toward God and that we are “determined” for God as our final end (i.e., cannot
conceivably rest finally in any other end)? I’m curious to know if part of the
answer lies in your “however gradually.” If we’re abandoning the categories of
determinism and libertarianism as a valid way to conceive of the will’s role
in human transformation, why should it take God any time at all to effect the
desired end? It would seem, if we suppose the transformation occurs “however
gradually,” that we’re assuming humans retain (even in our state of final
judgment) something of their power to interrupt the natural movement Godward.

I’m already on thin ice, but heck, why not? If your reply shatters the ice
beneath my feet and I disappear into the watery darkness below, I’ll see you
all on the other side anyway because universalism is true!

As for quoting the anathemas of the 5th Council: again, the council never
really had anything to do with them, they are a separate and irregular set of
condemnations, and even so they do not condemn universalism as such, and if
one cannot see that clearly then one is not reading the text, but only one’s
prejudices through the text.

You may be interested to know that I was a typical Evangelical, believing that
either heaven or hell was the destination of every human being, but came to
believe that everyone is going to heaven strictly by reading the Bible. That
is, I have never read a book on Universalism – either before or after I came
to this conclusion.

Paul Blowers has advanced a similar judgment in his recently published book
[_Maximus the
Confessor_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199673942/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99673942&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId=ESWZTPE3NAGUMVMY).

“We need to understand human being and agency not as a limit to God—created by
and as God’s act of self-limitation—but as existing within God’s freedom and
because of it, in absolute dependence on God’s supremacy. We need a way of
saying that God wills our free response and that our response is truly free
just because God wills it.”

But I cannot put dismiss Sergius Bulgakov’s suggestion that it is the world
that allows Satan to entertain his delusion that God is not his true good. But
eventually he will be expelled from the world and deprived of the world. He
will no longer have the world to “feed” on. At this point “Satan’s duel with
God begins,” Bulgavkov writes. “Can we, human beings, know anything about this
duel?”

As for Princeton, it is all a matter of health. I’m afraid I don’t know
anything about the next two years. Kind of you to ask, though.

Dale,  
Those two verses are actually universalist verses. Augustine’s curious
treatment of them was frequently to quote the first half of each (affirming
the universality of the Fall) but almost never the second (affirming the
universality of redemption).  
David

Part of the difficulty is that one should not isolate freedom and identity as
if one could focus purely on the individual. There’s the story in the
Brother’s Karamazov about the old woman in hell who once gave an onion to a
beggar. An angel tries to pull her out from infernal chains by the strength of
that single act of charity. Other souls try to cling to her and gain release
as well, and the old woman shouts, “it’s mine, mine” — and tumbles back into
the flames, of course. There is also Father Zossima’s mysterious claim that
“each is responsible for all.” This can only be an irrational puzzle for those
who have imbibed the ethos of modern, western individualism. But if the Triune
God is the exemplar of what it means to be a person, our creaturely experience
is analogous and only partially, incompletely, imperfectly approaches genuine
personhood.

Pass me a pint gentlemen! Brian, very helpful. Thank you. I’ll look up William
D as well.

By the way, the picture of free will advanced here is essentially that of
Maximus the Confessor.

Forgive my incessant probing, but I have to ask you about something (related
to created agency) which I’ve had on my mind since reading your book ‘The
Beauty of the Infinite’.

In this sophisticted work Griffiths argues for a free-will annihilationism:
human beings are ultimately free to embrace sin and pass into the nothingness
from which they were created. What makes his arguments particularly
interesting—and surprising—is that he is a Roman Catholic who seeks to norm
his reflections by the infallible pronouncements of the Magisterium. With
Balthasar, Griffiths believes that we must pray for the salvation of all,
though he deems the prospect unlikely, although not impossible. He agrees with
the universalist that the traditional claim that God would resurrect the dead
in order to condemn them to everlasting perdition violates the revealed
character of God as infinite and absolute Love.

I don’t follow. Is belonging to the Church the same thing as being rendered
magically sinless? And who denies that one can suffer spiritual harm? I am
sorry, but your question does not seem to have any relation to the claim being
made ( which, incidentally, is exactly the same claim as Maximus the Confessor
makes about freedom).

This book contains three essays by Talbott, followed mainly by critical
evaluations of Talbott’s writings from evangelical biblical scholars,
theologians, philosophers, as well as two essays on the history of
universalism in the Church. The book concludes with a response from Talbott to
his critics. This is an excellent book and well worth adding to one’s library.

I see St. Silouan being cited all over the place as a Universalist. I’m
confused. Based on my reading (some time ago), his famous prayer was “all
creation will be saved, and I alone will perish”. I just don’t see how this is
espousing Unversalism – he is exluding himself.

Or, who are you? “Brian” isn’t that uncommon a name. Tell me, are you Brian
Blessed (my favorite living Brian)?

May I identify myself as a former evangelical denominational pastor, executive
officer and Bible College president. I’ve been in active Christian ministry
for 64 years and continue a preaching assignment every Sunday. I embraced the
truth of universal salvation after many years of biblical study, research and
prayer. With this revelation my entire concept of God’s loving relationship to
humanity has been revolutionized.

The publication of _That All Shall Be Saved_ in 2019 was a major event. It
pushed the question of universal salvation to the theological front-burner.
The majority of online reviews, though, suggest that the brethren would rather
dismiss the universalist thesis as outright heresy rather than engage it
constructively and substantively. Fortunately all is not lost.

George MacDonald’s sermon “Love Thy Neighbour” has a passage so reminiscent of
Silouan’s remark that it is almost difficult to keep them distinct in one’s
memory.

Oh, I forgot, he quotes a bad translation of Gregory’s De infantibus too. Fr
John, read the Greek, in the Gregorii Nysseni Opera of Jaeger et al. On Cyril
and Athanasius, the arguments of various scholars on ther “disposition” is a
subtle but fascinating one, and Ramelli is actually quite good on that.

Excellent list. Don’t forget Julian of Norwich! I got started on the path to
full-blown universalism through her, especially in chapter 32 when the Lord
said, “I will preserve My word at every point, and I will make everything well
that is not well.” The fact that He refused to disclose the Great Deed that He
shall do on the Last Day to make all things well inspires us to love, pray,
and hope with complete trust and confidence.

In the general eschatological context, how must we consider these wildly
categorical affirmations of St. John Chrysostom concerning the chaining,
humiliation and death of hell – its annihilation? Let us state frankly – the
idea of eternal hell and eternal suffering for some and eternal bliss
(indifferent to suffering) for others, can no longer remain in the living and
renewed Christian conscience as it was formerly presented in our catechisms
and our official theology courses. This archaic conception which claims to be
based on the Gospel texts, understands them in a literal, coarse and material
sense, without penetrating the hidden spiritual meaning of the images and
symbols. This conception is increasingly showing itself to be an intolerable
violation of Christian conscience, thought and faith. We cannot accept that
the sacrifice of Golgotha has revealed itself to be powerless to redeem the
world and conquer hell. Otherwise we should say: creation is a failure, and
Redemption is also a failure. It is high time for all Christians to witness in
common and reveal their mystical experience – intimate in this area – as well
as their spiritual expectations, and perhaps also their revolt and horror
before materialistic, anthropomorphic representations of hell and the Last
Judgment, and of the heavenly Jerusalem. It is high time to be done with all
these monstrosities – doctrinal or not – often blasphemous, from ages past,
which make of our God of Love that which He is not: an ‘external’ God, who is
merely an “allegory of earthly kings and nothing else.” The pedagogy of
intimidation and terror is no longer effective. On the contrary, it blocks
entry into the Church to many who are seeking a God of Love “who loves
mankind” (the “Philanthropos” of the Orthodox liturgy).  
A holy monk of Mount Athos,20 a staretz who was almost our contemporary wrote
the following, addressed to every Christian: “If the Lord saved you along with
the entire multitude of your brethren, and one of the enemies of Christ and
the Church remained in the outer darkness, would you not, along with all the
others, set yourself to imploring the Lord to save this one unrepentant
brother? If you would not beseech Him day and night, then your heart is of
iron – but there is no  
need for iron in paradise.”  
And St. Paul, who was so truly united to Christ that he was able to affirm:
“It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me,” – did he not say
that he was ready to be “separated from Christ for his brothers?”  
Must not each of us plead with the Lord in the same way: May all my brothers
be saved along with me! Or otherwise, may I also be damned along with them!
Does not our Lord also wait for us to pray such a prayer? And would not this
prayer also be the solution to the ‘problem’ of hell and damnation?

“But what about Judas? the universalist is always asked. Judas is the test
case of the Savior’s love. Will Christ, can Christ, save his fallen apostle?

Fr Aidan call tell you how long I’ve complained about the idea that postmortem
salvation proceeds via an overwhelming revelation of truth that effectively
determines our ‘yes’ for God. ;o

The benefit of this view is that it still agrees with Jesus’ saying of, “No
one comes to the Father except through me” and allows for a Christian world
view when it comes to the potential of universalism. It’s not that all faiths
and religions lead to the same God, but that they could bring up different
aspects of Christianity that when Christ does return, they could recognize the
Jesus was the one all along, and the Holy Spirit has been wooing them all
along, and the Creator Covenant God does desire to be in relationship with us
all.

But here I’ll withdraw from the conversation. I will lay out my reasoning in
the book, if my health allows. God bless everyone (and I do mean everyone).

I know that Maximus often speaks of the gnomic will as simply the sinful and
deviating will. Something tells me–more a phenomenology of consciousness than
a moral metaphysics–that it might be better to think of it as the “third
moment” of the conscious act, so to speak, the first two being the primordial
intention of the natural will and the power of intellect (both being
rational). Then the gnomic will is that supremely rational moment of (ideally)
assent or love or creative liberty that completes the “trinitarian” movement
of the mind and makes it genuinely rationally free.

My point is just that this journey, this movement toward our telos in God,
requires a synergy in which the specific human ‘yes’ and ‘no’ we render are
not guarantees entailed God’s actions in/toward us (which I tend to see
universalists appeal to in order get a clear terminus ad quem). Thus my
concern with ‘epistemic distance’. Some ignorance is a ‘good’ thing, because
it makes creaturely becoming in the Good possible.

At the end of his life, the notable Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson came
to affirm universal salvation. For those acquainted with his theology, this
was not a surprise. The entirety of his project inevitably points to this
conclusion.

Much of Walls’s philosophical career has been devoted to matters
eschatological. In this 2015 book he pulls together his reflections for a
popular audience. It is clearly written, accessible, and affordable—highly
recommended. Also see my [multi-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/jerry-walls-heaven-hell-and-
purgatory/). For more in-depth treatment, read Walls scholarly trinity
(below).

Even if there is no such thing as efficacious grace by which God can
unilaterally convert the wicked, philosopher Eric Reitan argues that their
salvation is statistically certain, as long as God continues to offer his
forgiveness after death.

Here is my book-length treatment of the subject: [The Biblical Case for
Everyone Going to Heaven](http://wp.me/PNthc-i6)

Ludlow examines the eschatological convictions of St Gregory Nyssen in detail.
“Whoever considers the divine power,” Gregory writes, “will plainly perceive
that it is able at length to restore by means of the _aionion_ purging and
atoning sufferings, those who have gone even to this extremity of wickedness.”
Hell is purgation that culmi­nates in salvation. Gregory’s views on the
apocatastasis were not condemned by the Church at the 5th Ecumenical Council
and would later profoundly influence the eschatological reflection of Sergius
Bulgakov.

This recently published volume contains several essays by Bulgakov devoted to
eschatological and universalist themes. Many believe that this may be the best
introduction to Bulgakov’s theological vision.

The question was a bit long, but thank you David for clarifying! Excellent.

To a large extent, opposition to the greater hope is governed by a failure of
imagina­tion: we cannot _imagine_ how God can save all _if_ human beings are
truly free. The logic of eternal damnation binds our minds. In these homilies
MacDonald liberates our imagination and invites us into a vision of the Father
who loves infinitely and eter­nally. “Nothing is inexorable but love,” he
declares. The Father will never abandon his children.

Thank you, David. I first became interested in this view from reading
Archbishop Michael Ramsey’s “F. D. Maurice and the Conflicts of Modern
Theology”, (CUP, 1951) which explored the reasons for Maurice being expelled
from King’s College, London, for “unsound views and teachings about the
doctrine of eternal punishment”. In his Theological Essays, Maurice discussed
the use of “aionios” meaning eternal or everlasting, and outside “time”. Barth
writes at length about this- is there anything he doesn’t write at length?
maybe the Kennedy assassination- and Aidan’s note of von Balthasar’s, “Dare We
Hope All Men Be Saved” I found deeply impressive. T  
he last time I saw Ramsey in 1986, he was reading this and “The Glory of the
Lord”, vol. something.

Hayes synthesizes Catholic reflection on the last things over the past 50-60
years. This book is helpfully read alongside Ratzinger’s _Eschatology_.

William Desmond draws a distinction between the _conatus essendi_ (the
striving, struggle for living) and the _passio essendi_ (the pure giftedness
of our being which is the prior foundation upon which the latter derives.)
Modernity is largely blind to the _passio essendi_ and it would not see it as
freedom. Instead, it identifies freedom with something that is derivative,
secondary, and not really a metaphysically coherent concept of liberty. True
freedom as the perfected flourishing of one’s being is an eschatological
fruition that can be anticipated insofar as one’s actions bring one closer to
the unique gift of one’s being/vocation granted by the creator God.

_I will update this list as I continue to read on this subject._

There is also a Russian and a Greek parish in the Princeton area, but they
have very few converts.

Even so, I still cannot grant the liceity of the way you formulate freedom.
Part of it is that there is a difference between being “informed” in the
modern sense (possessing “information” and then, in a second movement of
deliberation, deciding upon it based upon some distinct set of criteria) and
being truly “in-formed” in the classical sense of being reshaped by the glory
of God. God is not a species of cognitive information in the former sense,
some finite object available to my judicious gaze. To know God is to be
transfigured into what is revealed. At that point of truest liberty, freedom
and necessity are no longer distinguished, any more than they are in the
Father’s own love of his own essence in the Son and Spirit. Remember, the only
thing to which Paul says we are predestined (well, marked out for in advance,
really) is to be conformed to the image of Christ. No less austerely apophatic
thinker than Maximus says that we achieve freedom (and are perfect as Christ’s
Father is perfect) when all distance (diastema) disappears and we rush into
the embrace of love.

Bulgakov’s is the most profound vision of the greater hope that I have read.

I guess my question is – if this is true, then why do communicating members of
the Church fall into greivous sin and error? Further, how does this relate to
the pre and post communion prayers which suggest that the effect of God’s
presence can be damaging to those who are unprepared or unrepentant?

But what is crystal clear is that the will of a baptized person is free, and
that freedom is ontologically a property of the will. And it is also crystal
clear that as our will is sanctified, glorified, deified–whatever term you
want to use–in Glory–and that it nevertheless is in the ontological sense,
*FREE*.

As long as the subject of Dr Hart’s fiction has come up, I’d like to express
how truly outstanding that collection is.

A helpful summary of how the question of Satan’s ultimate salvation has been
addressed by Christian theologians down through the centuries. “From the
outset,” Patrides writes, “one element clearly emerges: the conviction that
God’s love is all-inclusive and irresistible. The crucial issue, which
orthodox theologians repeatedly failed to grasp, was never whether Satan
should be, or could be, redeemed, but whether Divine Love may be limited in
any way, even to the extent of Satan’s exclusion from Grace.”

Sebastian Brock is one of the foremost scholars in the world on Syriac
Christianity. This essay is particularly valuable for the copious quotations
from St Isaac on the theme of apokatastasis. If you are unable to purchase the
[Second Part of St Isaac’s
discourses](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9068317091/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN68317091&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId=5QMUXTKLSRS4S5Z4)
(in which his eschatological homilies are contained), then you definitely want
to read this paper.

I am recommending this book for its chapter on St Isaac’s eschatology. More
than a few Orthodox priests have whispered to me: “I am a universalist at
heart, but I can’t tell anyone. St Isaac convinced me.” Why the power of St
Isaac’s writings? Because he _knew_ the power and unconditionality of God’s
love–hence his confidence that God will eventually win over the heart and mind
of every human being and every demon.

As a former Protestant, I can testify to the radical difference (at least
existentially) between living in the cacophony of the confessions, which
distinguished and perpetrated divisions and prescribed bounded sets as to what
we had to believe (including infernalism) … vis-a-vis my Orthodox experience
of the creeds as centered sets around which we unify, which also limit what we
may impose on others and allow for a freedom of theological thought and
discourse (that I see here).

Macrina seems rather hopeful, even for the demons [whatever they are]. And
this not without some warrant from Colossians 1, where even that which is
invisible is reconciled by his blood (and what might that be?) … and yet
Hebrews says that Christ came for the help of humans and specifically not
angels. And anyway, by the time we get to the desert fathers, ‘demons’ starts
taking on less of a ‘fallen angels’ backstory and sounds a lot more like what
alcoholics say when they describe ‘wrestling with their demons.’ (Anthony
excepted). So what to make of it?

But in any case, if we take Saul of Tarsus as an example, when Christ appeared
to him, was he coerced into salvation by the will of God? I don’t think so. Or
did he himself choose or will his response to Christ? I don’t think so. I just
don’t see ‘will’ being the primary faculty involved. Rather, he ‘saw’ and then
*naturally* repented and believed. His ‘nous’ was enlightened which then
activated his natural will. If there is anything to this, then what great hope
we might derive from the promise, ‘And every eye I shall see him’ … after
which ‘and every knee shall bow’ would make perfect sense.

Brad J: As it happens, I ordered your book from amazon just yesterday. Looking
forward to getting it and reading it. I enjoyed a blog post of yours from some
time ago about (among other things) the two Gregorys.

As for Dogen, the issue of enlightenment (or, technically, awakening) is a
somewhat different issue. But, of course, you are right that knowledge of
anything is not merely a discursive mastery of its attributes, but an
encounter, an intellectual intuition, in which there must be a surfeit of
mystery, or in which the intellect falls silent in being subsumed into…well,
ideally love. That is the yield of apophatic discipline in Maximus, after all.

Focusing on St Paul, Talbott invites us to read the Scriptures afresh,
temporarily bracketing our infernalist suppositions. We might be surprised by
what we find.

This article is one of a series on the eschatology of Sergius Bulgakov. He
contends that in the final judgment, all will see the risen Christ and in
their hearts will know the One in whose image they were made and know, by
comparison, how far they have fallen from the Image. “It is impossible,”
declares Bulgakov, to appear before Christ and to see Him without loving him.”

The eschatology of the Orthodox Church is notably underdetermined, in contrast
to that of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result diverse understandings exist
within her precincts. Turincev’s essay represents an excellent introduction to
the eschatology developed by the “Parisian school” of Orthodoxy in the 20th
century, as expressed in this quotation:

I am truly gratified you think well of my writing. Certainly, I would welcome
a venue to share my thoughts.

“The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom is one
in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance, wills
the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to achieve
that end without hindrance. ”

Do the Fathers differ on how free will and providence interact? Absolutely. Do
they differ on how grace and free will relates to “nature” of a person?
Absolutely. Are there various interpretations about how the post-lapsarian
will is wounded? Absolutely. Various interpretations about how a free will
really operates in the eschaton? Absolutely.

What that has to do with universalism is that, if it as persons that we are
saved, having achieved personhood through communion, rather than as abstract
essences, then the notion of an eternal hell becomes not only a problem for,
but an absolute barrier to, a coherent concept of salvation. But my dog needs
to be walked, so I can’t explain that now.

I take it the first just means the will is empowered by God (given God’s
purposes for its final end, mind you) to say ‘no’ (as well as ‘yes’) to
embracing God as its final end. I’m not sure what you mean by the second
claim. If you mean only that the will can never finally rest in anything other
than God, that God is the only thing it can finally convert to, then yes. But
if you mean that under the right circumstances (say, final judgment) our God-
given power to say ‘no’ can be converted irrespective of its exercise as a
power to interrupt itself, then I’m inclined to disagree…

Well, had a look. Not terrifically compelling, however angry. But this Fr John
fellow seems rather unaware of the full Greek and Syriac traditions of reading
the cardinal texts. Someone send him the last chapter of Solomon’s Book of the
Bee. (yes, a Chaldean, but with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Syrian
fathers.) Or Ilaria Ramelli’s latest book, which–for all its flaws–is full of
good citations and references. Or send him to fathers like Gregory of Nyssa or
Isaac of Ninevah, who fully reveal how they understand such terms as “αιωνιος”
or “le-alma” in the course of their expositions. Fr Aidan says Fr John is a
good man. Perhaps. But peremptory certitude allied with broad ignorance is not
piety, but mere fanaticism; and, whatever his personal virtues, this Fr John
fellow simply exhibits neither much scholarly range nor much theological
depth. The thing to recall is that, outside the Seven Councils, the licit
range of theological opinion is far larger than these self-appointed rigorists
know. They do not get to say whether, for instance, Evdokimov, or Olivier
Clement, or Bulgakov (etc.) are less truly Orthodox than they. (Or, to cite
the more moderate, “hopeful” universalists, Alfeyev or Ware.) They believe
their Orthodoxy IS Orthodoxy ( though inevitably they seem to cling to clearly
extra-canonical superstitions like the doctrine of the Tollhouses or bizarre
late 19th century Greek figures like Makrakis, and so on). They also seem to
think the Synodikon and the opinions of certain bishops have an authority that
they clearly do not. Even holy bishops (saints are frequently bad thinkers).
It would be so much easier for them if Orthodoxy had a pope, I suppose, and a
magisterium, and some organ for declaring opinions heresy even on matters not
determined by the ecumenical councils. Alas, it is not so. And, unless another
council is convoked, I fear that merely reciting the opinions (which is all
they are) of certain “holy men” or “holy texts” (rather than others) is not
the same thing as making a good argument. (Oh, but I’ll play along: the
doctrine of the Tollhouses is a crypto-gnostic heresy and those who hold to it
are not TRULY TRULY Orthodox. I make this pronouncement entirely upon the
basis of my own personal predilections and my own unauthorized but very deeply
felt sense of what I have decided to believe is TRUE Orthodoxy, drawn from
sources I have endued with ultimate authority.)

Also, let me confess that I am not well-read in universalism, so my responses
can’t be entirely fair to y’all as I’m not working from a lot of the common
source material. That being said, I find this conversation very interesting
and will continue to read up on the question.

Anyway, let Fr John believe as he believes. I have encountered that sort of
Orthodox or Catholic before. They are often the most vigorous in good works
too (being far nicer, it seems, than the God their theology describes).

A different kind of devil altogether. If you like “The House of Apollo,”
incidentally, by that alone you can gain entrance to paradise–without even
having to go through the Tollhouses.

Origen did NOT invent the doctrine of universal salvation. Going back to the
second century there existed a position that may be described as “intercessory
universalism.”

Our creation in Christ has made us, by vocation, into beings to whom the
Father is as essential as he is, by paternity, to the Son himself. But we
should not forget the other face of this mystery, whereby we appear, in
Christ, as eternally irreplaceable to the Father as the Son is to him.
Confronted with the suicidal decision to reverse into hatred the love for
which we have all been created and which makes us, in the Father’s eyes,
inseparable from the person of his Son, could God, even out of respect for our
freedom, abandon forever the person who destroys himself in the self-torture
of his aberration? How could he do so, this God who, in Christ wishes to raise
us by pure grace to his likeness, and promises to share with us the life of
his uncreated Son? Such is the choice of the unfathomable depth of his love
for us. Henceforth there is no human rule, no safeguard of morality that can
prohibit God from loving madly the madman who believes that in order to exist
he must refrain from loving him who is love itself! God’s remedy for madness
consists then in bringing into play all the resources of his love to help the
rebel overcome his insane refusal to love. For what kind of God would he be
who, despite being declared all-powerful, was forever incapable of releasing
from his mortal spell a freedom that was received without being requested, and
that could become a snare of pain and hatred to its recipient, for all
eternity?

For a helpful exposition of MacDonald’s views, see Thomas Talbott, “[Universal
Salvation in the Theology of George
MacDonald](http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/George%20MacDonald%20chapter.pdf).”
Regarding MacDonald’s speculations on how God might convert the wicked after
death, see my article “[The Hell of Self and the Redemption of the Outer
Darkness](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/the-hell-of-self-and-the-
redemption-of-the-outer-darkness/).”

Well, its perfect harmonization with, restoration to, and ultimate
indistinction from the natural will. But, then, that is not elimination, but
rather salvation.

That Nazianzus gathers and affirms the philocalia of Origen seems a part of
the same project. It would have saved us some pain if they had formally
declared Origen a father at their council. However, it is not without import
that Benedict XVI numbered Origen as one of the fathers in his book on the
Fathers.

It is generally assumed by Orthodox believers that the doctrine of everlasting
damnation enjoys the status of irreformable or infallible dogma. It is
therefore necessary to examine the nature of dogma and what it means, at least
for the Orthodox, to characterize a dogmatic statement as irreformable. As we
see in this article, matters are more complex than popularly taught,
especially when it comes to eschatological questions.

I understand (and accept) Plato’s view that all willing is ultimately desire
for the Good in itself. That is a question about the final cause of the will.
But I’m curious: to be truly free does the will necessarily have some kind of
an ‘arbitrary spontaneity’ as an efficient cause?

Homo_](https://www.academia.edu/38365832/Anselmian_Apocatastasis_The_Fitting_Necessity_of_Universal_Salvation_in_St_Anselms_Cur_Deus_Homo)”

Think of Ware as the Orthodox counterpart to Balthasar on the topic of the
universa­list hope. Like Balthasar, he does not believe we can affirm anything
stronger than a hope. In Ware’s judgment there is no way to rationally resolve
the irresolvable conflict between divine love and human freedom. All we can do
is to firmly hold them together in tension, “while admitting that the manner
of their ultimate harmonization remains a mystery beyond our present
comprehension.”

Do you enjoy analytic philosophical reflection on the hell? You’ll find a
number of interesting essays in this volume, including a piece by Talbott on
free will and character formation and a piece by Jerry Walls on
annihilationism. Check out the table of contents on the Amazon page.

Yaakov, I cannot imagine myself commending to parishioners, either in a homily
or by way of spiritual counsel, that they adopt St Antony’s prayer “All will
be saved except I.” Perhaps certain ascetics can **safely** adopt such a
prayer, but I do not think that most ordinary believers can. It seems to
violate the gospel-word of unconditional love and would too easily generate
despair and scrupulosity.

You may be right, Marc. I am agnostic when it comes to the demonic powers, as
it seems to me that all of our speculation about them is precisely
that–speculation. We do know anything about their nature and existence. All we
know is their enmity toward God and toward us. Satan is our enemy. Hence I am
content to remain agnostic. Perhaps they are beyond repentance and thus beyond
salvation.

My over all problem with all will be saved, is that the agape we know in God
the Holy Trinity is not coercive.

I think I see where you’re coming from Shane. For my part, this is where I
imagine (with Paul, I think, in 1 Cor. 15) that omnipotent love graciously
initiates the parousia in all its efficacy, and everlasting blessedness is not
something we can either achieve by our goodness or sabotage by our delusions …
Rather, when the True Light shines, the darkness of delusion will be dispelled
and healing love will do its work on our hearts … the synergism of this, I
hope, will be the genuine, willing response of someone being brought back from
the dead (DBH’s ‘third moment’). In other words, we’re counting on a love
greater in its illuminating power than the blindness of whatever veils of
unbelief and defiance we’ve pulled over our own eyes.

Of course, one can then get into the old wrangles between Thomists and
Scotists over the priority of intellect or will in knowing God. And the
Scotists are routinely misrepresented in that regard, since for them intellect
is not the same as reason and will is not the same as spontaneous arbitrium;
both are rational movements of the soul. And really, after all, both are
really one and the same movement; they are not genuinely separable faculties.
Intellect is informed because it is intentional, and therefore has a natural
velleity towards the world and towards the transcendental horizon of truth.
Will is a rational movement towards a perceived end, and therefore naturally
follows (as best it can) the light of intellect. There really is no need here
to assign priority: the final end is a kingdom of love and knowledge, the two
proving to be infinitely identical

I don’t dispute our groundedness in God, nor the undeniable primordial God-
given desire that animates the will (as David’s described), the act of every
act, nor that the end of whatever sort of agency/action it is by which means
we resolve ourselves shall finally end in a perfect and irrevocable harmony
with God.

Also it seems to me what you are saying is logically confused. Given certain
assumptions about God (the ones being made in this thread), either God is the
final Good (Good in itself) or he is not. This means that the argument you
cannot avail yourself of is God is the final Good and something else is the
final Good as well. It amounts to saying there are two Gods. But if that is
right, then, strangely enough, there are no Gods, because something cannot be
God, as we understand him, and something else also be God. It amounts to
saying A and ~A which is logically contradictory. Moreover, if both are the
Good in itself, then it seems reasonable to suppose that they are essentially
identical which, according to a decent metaphysical principle, means there is
one final Good, not two.

P.S. What are the chances that you will be coming to Princeton in the next two
years?

Capon described the writing of this book a “watershed experience” and
considered it his most important book. It’s difficult to describe. The first
part is a parable of two adulterous lovers, Paul and Laura, with Caponic
commentary. Many will find the parable scandalous, because the two lovers do
not repent of their sin. Capon, of course, is not endorsing sin (despite
appearances, he is not an antinomian); but he wants us to see that
unconditional love (represented by Laura) transcends moralism. The second part
is an imaginary coffee house Q&A between Capon and his parish­ioners. The
third part is another parable—this time a parable about the gangster-style
execution of a New Jersey mobster. Is it possible for God to forgive murder,
redeem murder? Yes, Capon boldly asserts. Evil is eternally enveloped, judged,
and redeemed within the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

If you’re just beginning to reflect on eternal damnation, this may be the book
with which to begin. Four Protestant scholars present the retributive,
annihilationist, free will, and universalist positions and respond to the
contributions of the others. Robin Parry’s essay on universalism is
particularly fine.

Again, I think compatibilism and determinism are both inapposite to the
question of freedom; they concern a libertarian model of free acts that I
believe logically vacuous. But my hostility towards analytic philosophy and
its native categories occasionally verges on the unreasonable. Simply said,
all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will reach that end,
and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption prevents them; but
rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still, willy-nilly, all
natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as bliss or torment,
but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot not convert the
will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will never be all in
all and creation will never be completed. That teleological understanding of
the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be forced into the
categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I honestly wish
Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories for that
reason.

A fine article that Jersak wrote for Eclectic Orthodoxy. He maintains that the
universalist hope remains a legitimate option within the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Do not let others tell you otherwise.

I would see a distinction between the hopeful inclusivism of Ware and
Balthasar and the ultimate redemption of which Gregory (and Macrina) were so
confident. It seems to me that there are two types of hopeful inclusivism that
stop short of Gregory. First, those like Ware and Balthasar who insist on the
possibility (in principle, even if ‘infinitely improbable’) that some might,
in the end, resist divine love because of ‘free will.’ Another version,
somewhat softer, and perhaps in both Origen and Barth, that might say, ‘We
believe is as mystery, but cannot teach it as doctrine,’

Bulgakov’s famous essay in which he argues for the final redemption of the
fallen angels. His argument is similar to that the argument he presents for
the universal salvation of humanity in _Bride of the Lamb_ , yet he also
recognizes that it will be accomplished differently because of the differences
between angelic spirits and embodied human beings made in the _Imago Dei_. The
salvation story of Satan can only begin when he has been cast out of the world
into the void.

This, in a nutshell, is the reason it is hard for me NOT to be a universalist.
How could true freedom result in anything but one’s salvation? The alternative
would be a god who allows certain beings to remain damned by their ignorance.

I review the argument of Kronen and Reitan that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if the lost suffer everlastingly.

One might conceivably see _passio essendi_ as being lacking will, but I think
it is better to see it as a compact, elemental gift from which all other
powers derive. It is not so much a lack of freedom as a richness that includes
a joyous reception of being that grounds reason and will. I take it that the
libertarian objection is that somehow authentic freedom would require,
contradictorily, a lack of metaphysical freedom or some quality of the
indeterminate in order to remain free, but this is just to posit freedom
wrongly to begin with.

Universal salvation is the only “tolerable” answer to evil and suffering in
the world.

This is powerfully imaged in the play, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.”
Spoiler alert: The version I saw ends with Judas condemned to hell, Christ
pleading with him even as Judas fades into a catatonic state, and Christ
remains with him. The lights dim as Jesus washes his feet.

This six-article series on St Isaac the Syrian might be considered as a
systematic mini-presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, concluding in the
eschatological reconciliation of sinful humanity and fallen angels with their
eternal Creator. Please read the series in order. But if are too impatient to
read the entire series, I give you permission to skip to the end: “[The
Triumph of the Kingdom Over
Gehenna](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/23/the-triumph-of-the-kingdom-

Satan](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/30/the-demonic-void-and-the-

Personhood is not simply a given, but a task. At minimum, we should recognize
that the relational dimension of the person is just as constitutive of
identity as what one might think of as a “substantial core.” Or, if I can cite
Desmond once more, there is a porosity to personal being both in terms of the
deep structure of the soul and our natural openness to the exterior other. We
are “wholes” in our irreplaceable singularity that paradoxically realize our
integrity through dyanamic, dramatic interaction with the Other (an
interaction with the infinite capacity for novelty — the eternal is not
synonymous with closure or some kind of totalizing completion.)

First read Brad Jersak’s article “[Apocatastatic
Hymnody](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/let-every-mortal-leap-for-
joy-apocatastatic-hymnody-in-orthodox-worship/)” and then follow up with this
article. In addition to noting the universalist-orientation of Orthodox
hymnody, Howell also discusses the Last Judgment hymns, often cited as
testimony for the everlasting damnation position. His conclusion: when we
read, hear, and sing the hymns of the Orthodox Church, “we realize that the
universalist hope never did disappear” in the life of the Church.

The Synodikon is just a compendium, and at times a converses, and possesses
only as much authority as what it is quoting at any point. In itself it is no
more binding on the conscience of an Orthodox than the Baltimore Catechism or
a Thomist manual is on the conscience of a Catholic.

Eric C.: I think that even among those who believe in libertarian free will
(no determinism), many, perhaps most, still believe that God can foreknow what
we will freely do (even if God can’t cause us to do what we do, if we’re to be
free). If you think universalism is revealed in inspired scripture, you
needn’t buy into determinism, but just divine foreknowledge.  
(Actually for me, that doesn’t help, because I’m among the minority who think
God cannot even foreknow, at least with absolute certainty, what we will
freely do. But I still count myself a universalist. I think that so long as
you accept that it’s overwhelmingly probable that all will be saved, you
should count. I also have another scheme by which the salvation of all might
be absolutely certain, but won’t go into that here.)

What a delight to see David Bentley Hart’s thoughts. My own notes were that
two of the texts commonly viewed as signalling eternal punishment were based
on mis-readings by St. Augustine: namely the Romans 5:18, and the I
Corinthians 15:22, as suggested to me by David. I added the specific
references from St. Augustine’s Epistles, and his Contra Jul., again having
pointed in those directions by David. I hope I have the transliterated Greek
accurate.

A courageous essay by a Polish Catholic theologian. Hryniewicz directly
challenges centuries of the pedagogy of fear. The section “Is God Helpless in
the Face of the Gift of Freedom?” is particularly illuminating. “God himself
is the greatest hope for all His creatures,” Hryniewicz writes. “He penetrates
even the infernal depths of the human heart. He can lead out of the depths of
Gehenna. He does not destroy the freedom of rational beings, but respects
human choice. However, he has his truly divine way of persuading the freedom
of the beings most in revolt. He attracts and transforms them from the inside
through His goodness, beauty and boundless love manifested above all in the
voluntary kenosis of Christ.”

It’s not doubtful in the Orthodox Church — it is only very recently that you
could cite any Orthodox writers who have espoused universalism. The only
reason St. Gregory of Nyssa’s teachings on this subject (if in fact he ever
taught such a thing) were not condemned by that council was because it was
argued that the quotes you refer to were origenistic interpolations. There is
a similar argument that the quotes from St. Isaac of Syria you refer to are
not his genuine writings. However, even if we grant, for the sake of argument,
that these quotes are authentically the work of those saints, there is zero
evidence that the Church ever embraced those ideas, and mountains of evidence
that they rejected them. The odd opinion of one saint or another does not
trump an ecumenical council. One need only read the patristic commentaries on
Matthew 25:45 “And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life” to see whether the Church thinks that when our
Lord speaks of everlasting punishment, he really mean everlasting punishment.

Hi, everyone. I am temporarily closing the comments on this page. It really is
not intended for extended discussion, but I allowed it to continue because we
often do not get a visitor of the intellectual caliber of David Hart. My
special thanks to David for addressing our many questions.

I’m fascinated by the force of fiction to open a way to such hope: Would CS
Lewis, Great Divorce count, as least as the first step across the bridge?

The traditional view says no. Death finalizes the sinner’s orientation to God.
But why believe this is so? All explanations seem fatuous and unconvincing.
They presuppose the doctrine of everlasting damnation. In this piece I
summarize the view of the great Sergius Bulgakov. Bulgakov dismisses the
school opinion that death freezes the human person: “the disincarnation in
death does not suppress the activity of the spirit.” The afterlife presents
new possibilities!

Analytic philosophy does not own words like “determined,” incidentally. My
problem is specifically with the current analytic categories of determinism,
compatibilism, libertarian freedom, etc., because they all presume an
originally voluntarist understanding of free will, which is simply incoherent.
When I use “determined” in that sentence, I am just speaking of final
causality, primary causality.

The truth shall set you free! It is our ignorance that leaves us to make
inferior choices.

A very interesting discussion…On reading the posts, some quite technical and
others quite poetic and evocative, I could not help but think of the need for
this type of conversation to be more broad in that such a topic has also been
addressed in other religious traditions. I think, for instance, of the
Buddhist tradition, ( Mahayana), of the Bodhisattvas who refuse entering total
enlightenment until all beings are also saved, enlightened.  
On ignorance and enlightenment, Dogen Zenji is quite adamant that
enlightenment occurs in the midst of ignorance. He upholds a paradoxical way,
one that I find challenging to our usual black/white, binary logic.  
At any rate, I find the discussion to have been, for me, quite fruitful and
encouraging. I hope the participants, all of them, find the goal they are
earnestly striving for.

This is a long-ranging article in which I respond to a piece by the Catholic
theologian and Balthasar expert Dr Larry Chapp. Following Balthasar, Chapp
confesses a hopeful, but non-necessary, universalism: God may save all, we
should pray that he will save all, but in the end he may not. What is this
“may not” but an admission that God may turn out not to be as good as we hoped
he would be?

This is entirely the wrong place to do it, but since I don’t know when I’ll be
within shouting distance of Dr. Hart again, I want to say that the moment in
“The Devil and Pierre Gernet” when Pierre’s soul is taken to heaven and the
demon bewails the “gross liberality of interpretation” with which God judges
man… well, that whole passage deserves to rank among the best universalist
texts of the last thousand years or so.

Hi, everyone. I’m stepping in here and asking everyone to return to the theme
of the page–the hope of universal salvation. Thank you.

William Lane Craig has sought to rebut the claim that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if there is a hell by suggesting that they will be so
enraptured by their vision of God that they will not give the damned a second
thought. But how is this not a failure to love?

Keith DeRose is not a biblical scholar. He is a philosopher at Yale
University. Like Tom Talbott, he believes that the Apostle Paul ultimately
taught a doctrine of uni­versal salvation. He begins his article with this
judgment: “Contrary to what many would suppose, universalism … receives strong
scriptural support in the New Testament. Indeed, I judge the support strong
enough that if I had to choose between universalism and anti-universalism as
the ‘position of Scripture,’ I’d pick universalism as the fairly clear
winner.” I certainly would not say a “clear winner,” but the case is stronger
than many believe.

Desmond is a friend of mine, incidentally, and I do not know if I have ever
found cause to disagree with him on anything.

Second, freedom as defined in a purely voluntarist, spontaneous, atelic
movement of the will–pure libertarian freedom–might be denied by the doctrine
of apokatastasis. But that is a logically incoherent model of freedom in any
event. The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom
is one in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance,
wills the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to
achieve that end without hindrance. Thus God is perfectly free precisely
because he cannot work evil, which is to say nothing can prevent him from
realizing his nature as the infinite Good. Similarly, for Gregory of Nyssa or
Gregory of Nazianzus, perfect freedom is liberation from the fetters of
ignorance that constrain the rational will from seeing the Good as what it is.
For Augustine, the highest freedom is the perfection of human nature in a
condition of “non posse peccare.” For Maximus, the natural will is free
because it tends inexorably towards God, and the gnomic will is free precisely
to the degree that it comes into harmony with the natural will. And so on.
Since, after all, all employments of the will are teleological–necessarily
intentionally directed towards an end, either clearly or obscurely known by
the intellect–and since the Good is the final cause of all movements of the
will, no choice of evil can be free in a meaningful sense. For evil is not an
end, and so can be chosen under the delusion that it is in some sense a good
in respect of the soul (even if, in moral terms, one is aware that one is
choosing what is conventionally regarded as “evil”); and no choice made in
ignorance can be a free choice.

Saint Silouan was famous for saying, “all will be saved, and I alone will
perish”. That is not Universalism, it’s humility.

“Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the teaching
of eternal perdition became the teaching of the Church.”

Morwenna Ludlow, _[Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory
of Nyssa and Karl
Rahner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199566968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99566968&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20)_

I had a professor in seminary that spoke of one theory that arises from the
question, “What about the salvation of God’s chosen people the Jews? (for the
evangelicals) Those before Jesus that it was and could have been credited to
them salvation by faith). And the theory went something like this: When Jesus
returns EVERYONE is resurrected and every tongue confessing and every knee
bowing that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, Lord, and King. And it would be at
that point that the Jews would see the messiah coming in the way that they
have always been expecting. And everyone would be able to either recognize the
one and true God and choose to continue to be in relationship with the God, or
they would be wooed by the Holy Spirit to desire to start that relationship
beyond this life. And of course, for anyone that chooses to not be in
relationship with our three-fold Godhead, then there would be a place for them
that would not be in the presence and relationship with God, and that would be
like eternal torment to choose to not be in a relationship with the Trinity
that they were create to be in.

Weighing in at over 900 pages, this is a massive work of first-rate
scholarship on the theme of universal salvation in the first millennium
Christian Church. This book is now mandatory reading for anyone who wishes to
advance an opinion about what the Church Fathers believed and taught. You will
be surprised. The universalist hope was far more prevalent than I ever knew.
It was not restricted to Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa. Even St Augustine
apparently believed in a form of apocatastasis early in his episcopal career.
Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the standard
teaching of everlasting perdition became the teaching of the Church.

In his great work _The City of God_ , St Augustine identifies seven
universalist and semi-universalist positions that were prevalent in his day
(early 400s). Though he disagreed with all of them, he only judged one of them
as heretical—specifically, the assertion that Satan and the demons will be
saved. Note: he did not consider the claim that all humanity will be saved as
heretical.

What are the conditions of rational freedom, and does the choice to reject God
definitively fulfill them?

Yakoov, St Isaac the Syrian certainly thought so. See my series on [Isaac and
universalism](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/st-isaac-the-syrian-
preaching-the-astonishing-love-of-god/).

Dame Julian of Norwich was probably not a universalist, not explicitly so, but
her visions of Christ provide a strong case for the salvation of all. Clearly
the greater hope dwelt deep in her heart. “All shall be well.”

Oh, and there is no “heresy of apokatastasis.” Unless you know of an
ecumenical council that, unlike the 5th, really proclaimed there is. If you
won’t call it a heresy, I won’t say anything similar of those whose theology
is so clearly a rejection of 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 11, not to mention
all of 1 Timothy.

LOL. I’m going to need to get a job before getting this book but it does look
interesting and weighty.

In this fine piece, Klager articulates a cosmic eschatology grounded in
humanity’s ontological union with the Incarnate Word. He features St Gregory
of Nyssa, but he also draws on the Divine Liturgy and the ascetical tradition
on _theosi_ _s_. He concludes by affirming a universalist hope along the lines
advocated by Ware and Evdokimov.

Perhaps my fears are inspired by versions of universalism I’ve encountered in
which people imagine God instantaneously kicking the doors of our hearts open
and blasting all falsehood away, essentially leaving us no other option but
God, in which circumstance we ‘make the right choice’. I confess I find it
difficult to believe God would be very interested in our coming to conclude he
is our only option under such conditions. But that doesn’t seem to be
anybody’s position here.

Not that I would care if it did. That very imperial “ecumenical ” council is
an embarrassment in Christian history, and I sometimes think it a mercy that
such a hash was made of its promulgation that we literally do not know what
was truly determined there. For my money, if Origen was not a saint and church
father, then no one has any claim to those titles. And the contrary claims
made by a brutish imbecile Emperor are of no consequence.

Thanks again for taking the time to clarify. You have said that what you are
arguing is essentially communicated in the works of Gregory of Nyssa, Isaac,
Maximus, and George MacDonald; so it may be that I should read them first and
then return to comment.

The gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a message of
triumph and unconquerable hope: God will reconcile all sinners to himself in
the eschatological transfiguration of the cosmos. This hope therefore
authorizes preachers to proclaim the gospel in the performative mode of
unconditional promise. This paper was delivered at a conference in Cardiff,
Wales in 2014 and subsequently [published in the journal _Logos_
(2017)](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/preaching-
apokatastasis.pdf).

I heard a funny story by Kallistos Ware. He was embarking on a long drive with
another hierarch. He thought to pass the time he would bring this up. Will
even the demons be saved? To which the hierarch boomed, ‘None of your
business,’ and that was that for that topic. 🙂

That said, it also seems to me that in light of this, ‘will’ may not be the
locus of salvation in the first place, but rather the ‘nous.’ Briefly, worries
about coercion (the will of God imposed) or ‘free’ vs. ‘bondage’ of the human
will are all still fixated on the primacy of the will in salvation (whether
God’s or our own). However, what I in Scripture is that the divine Nous both
creates and enlightens the God-given human ‘nous’ (the eyes of the heart/mind,
poorly translated ‘intellect’) in order to ‘see the light of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ’ (2 Cor. 4) … something we cannot see as long as
we’re blinded by the god of this age. For whatever reason, some see in this
age and some do not (where ‘see’ is also a metaphor for love). Paul says that
apart from this ‘seeing,’ we cannot respond. And yet if we do ‘see,’ we are
capacitated for an uncoerced response.

David’s article in First Things on Augustine’s misread of Rom. 9-11 was
especially helpful.

“The moral conscience may accept hell, understood in the sense of a state of
purification of the soul – lasting, perhaps, but not perpetual. But here is
what matters: hell can be vanquished, and it is already vanquished. This is
the central affirmation of our Faith. To believe in Christ is to believe in
His victory over hell. He is the vanquisher of death and of hell. He is our
Deliverer. He alone can liberate us from hell, even now or in the next life.
It should be added that the Orthodox Church disregards the Latin distinction
of hell and purgatory. She prays for all the dead and does not accept that
there are any who are already damned forever. The existence beyond the grave
is nothing but the continuation of the deceased’s destiny, with its
progressive purifying and liberating action – a healing, a maturation and a
creative expectation.”

My struggle in understanding the inescapable conclusion of universalism still
rests in not understanding why a human person is not capable of continually
refusing to accept God’s salvific offer of Himself in Christ. So I have a
couple questions which might help further clarify the argument.

Thus Silouan’s famous rebuke of the hermit who gleefully rejoiced in the
eternal punishment of atheists: “Love could not bear that. We must pray for
all.” Similarly, when asked by Olivier Clement what would happen if a person
does not agree to open his or her heart and accept the love of God, Sophrony
replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell, Christ will
remain there with him.”

Come to think of it, even the priests I know who reject universalism have
still been very welcoming. For instance, my priest back home (I’m from the
Northwest U.S.) was a fan of Fr. John, but he never saw my inclination towards
universalism as something that should exclude me.

It seems the heresy of apokatastasis presented here isn’t really molesting
Orthodox eschatology or soteriology as much as it cuts asunder the dogma of
Orthodox anthropology that says that baptized human persons have free will.

As it happens, I number among my friends and acquaintances some of the
greatest scholars of Orthodox canons and councils and history in the world;
and to a man they would assert that the Orthodox Church–no matter what the
inclinations of its catechists and prelates may have been down the ages–has
never definitively condemned universalism as such, or even addressed it under
any synodical or conciliar conditions of special import. It has condemned some
teachings that are also, as it happens, universalist. But the sort of
universalism found in Gregory and Isaac, which fully acknowledges the reality
of judgment and hell, has never even been addressed.

I am pretty sure that if this was a dream I would be married to Kate Upton.

Thomas Allin, D.D., lived at a time when it was not unusual for an Anglican
parish priest to also be an eminent scholar. He also lived at a time when a
growing number of British Protestants were challenging the received doctrine
of everlasting damnation. _Christ Triumphant_ is a classic work of this period
and is noteworthy for its presentation of the patristic witness to the larger
hope, as well as its strong theological case for the greater hope. Highly
recommended.

Man was not created perfect. Man was created innocent and according to
Gregory, I think, as moral toddlers. This makes the fall inevitable and
therefore, mercy is ultimately God’s only just response. (riffing off Dr
Andrew Klager, an Orthodox universalist). Perfection is the telos of theosis
rather than the first state.

Chenoweth surveys the key texts in St Maximus’s writings and concludes that if
he was not an outright universalist, he was certainly sympathetic to it.
Superficially Maximus appears to have affirmed universal damnation, yet there
are many elements in his theology that point to apokatastasis.

This article may be the best introduction to Talbott’s approach to universal
salvation. Start here! After you have read this, you should have a good idea
whether you want to read anymore of Talbott’s work.

Harmon examines how Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St Gregory of Nyssa
sought to ground their hope for universal salvation in the biblical story and
their reading of Holy Scripture.

Regarding your series on St Isaac, which was englightening, I don’t see where
it shows that the two ideas are separated. You do say that St. Isaac doesn’t
go into God’s method for effecting everyone’s eventual choosing of Him, but
that doesn’t rule out pre-destination.

This is my multi-article commentary on David Hart’s _That All Shall Be Saved_.
My hope is that others will find it helpful in grasping David’s key arguments.
Together these articles present what I believe is a compelling argument that
God will restore all sinners to himself in his Kingdom.

I hope that you, Fr. Kimel, and the many other universalists and hopeful
universalists out there continue to engage in the conversation.

I still question the logic of a teleological approach leading inescapably to
universalism. Why is it not possible that some persons will never come to
regard God as their final Good and, thus, never freely choose Him? I agree
that true freedom is found in the true worship and service of God, but I do
not understand why some could not remain forever in the delusion that
something (or more likely someone?) other than God is their final Good. Am I
missing an element in the argument?

I wouldn’t suggest that the more ignorant we are the more free we are.
Epistemic distance is qualified on both ends. It can’t be maximized, for then
we would be absolutely ignorant and incapable of choosing God. We have to be
sufficiently informed, obviously. But can the distance be reduced to zero, in
which case we would be so informed, so overwhelmed by the truth, that no
possible means of constructing a ‘no’ to God would be possible?

However, saying, “I alone will perish” is not a Universalist statement. Are
there other statements that he made suggesting that he was a Universalist?

True. But which of my books, I ask myself, do you mean? Buy them all, I say.

God can guarantee the conversion of the wicked by bestowing upon them a
perfect vision of himself as the Good.

You are free to go home after work today, you are free to drink whiskey once
home, you are free to be selfish or unselfish, mean or nice, and so on. But
your free choices have nothing whatsoever to do with choosing between hell or
heaven. Your ultimate destiny is a matter of God’s grace, I would think. But
of course your choices can help decide how you go about getting there. That
is, how God is going to reconcile you to himself, how difficult or easy that
process is is going to depend on your free choices, to some at least limited
extent, I think, choices have consequences after all. Simply put, free will is
not in tension with universal salvation, and I don’t see how one can read Paul
any other way and get it to make sense.

“But the the Church dogmatically denounced all expressions of apokatastasis,”
the critic confidently declares, pointing to the anathemas allegedly
pronounced by the Fifth Ecumenical Council. But matters are not so simple. The
anath­emas in question were (1) never formally approved by the Council, (2)
are directed against the strange and esoteric teachings of the 6th century
Origenists, and (3) do not condemn the construals of apokatastasis advanced by
St Gregory of Nyssa, St Isaac of Nineveh, and contemporary proponents of the
greater hope.

Too long a question. I think I have been pretty clear in saying that the
conversion in question is necessarily a conversion of the will through its own
free (and progressively freer) act. Even the will’s power to say no, however,
is animated by its primordial hunger for the Good and, as Gregory and others
argue, to that it cannot say no, except by ceasing to exist. That is the act
of all its acts. So, in time, over the ages perhaps, it continues to seek its
rest in God, freely but, for that reason, inevitably.

Dale, you may find my multi-article review of Tom Talbott’s book _The
Inescapable Love of God_ of interest. Several of these articles address New
Testament texts. The results are often surprising. And the comment threads are
quite interesting, too! <https://goo.gl/BrsRp9>

Thanks for the recommendation on Sergius Bulgakov from this blog. He looks
pretty clean as well.

Which, incidentally, does not break from the “synergist” view. It is merely to
say that the cooperation of the created will with God’s is still a
cooperation–if needs be by terrible purgation–in restoring a human soul to its
natural state. I think of Gregory of Nyssa deals with this quite delightfully
and cogently in De anima et resurrectione.

I think the most important phrase of those anathemas is from 1. “which follows
from it,” identifying, as DBH has said earlier, the problem is only a
particular version of apokatastasis that ‘follows from’ the broader (and
immediate) problematic worldview — one which Gregory of Nyssa had explicitly
repudiated, thereby not only allowing for his own version, but also
rehabilitating Origen’s? (well in advance of the 5th council).

As it happens, the next work of technical theology I plan to write is on
precisely that topic. Unfortunately, I have been very ill these past 15
months, so I do not know when or if I shall write it. But my translation, I
hope, will come to be thought of as The Apokatastatic Standard Version.

I should have some coffee. Ss Macrina, Gregory Nyssen, Gregory Nazianzen, and
Isaac Syrus pray for us all. St George MacDonald of Aberdeenshire too.

Both of these fly in the face of the faith delivered once and for all that
says that a baptized human person has free will now, *AND* will have free will
in the eschaton.

This has been one of my favorites since it was first published in 1990. The
influence of C. S. Lewis upon Kreeft is manifest. It was here that I first
encountered the view that purgatory is an anteroom of heaven.

It may be that I simply have not come across universalists of that variety. I
am familiar with patristic universalists, with a variety of mediaeval and
modern figures, I revere George MacDonald especially…but I probably am
entirely unaware of a great deal of popular universalism.

I can’t believe that two heroes of mine (Fr Aidan) and Dr Hart) are denying
it. Christ have mercy… on us all.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

> A necessary truth is one that could not have been otherwise. It would have
> been true under all circumstances. A contin­gent truth is one that is true,
> but could have been false. A necessary truth is one that must be true; a

> If a proposition is only true in all the worlds that are physically

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

          * ![](https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2395ba4b16f3121ec6a3a049306e78a?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) kenanada says:

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/if-god-is-going-to-deify-everyone-
anyway-why-not-deify-everyone-immediately/>  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/creation-theodicy-and-the-problem-
of-evil-2/>

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

> alternatives or he is necessitated to create situates God within a total
> framework of possibilities, as though the logical conditions of possibility
> and impossibility were prior to and more universal than God, conditions to

Posted on [14 July 2018](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/ "6:43 am") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr
Aidan Kimel")

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

9 See Marilyn Adams, ‘The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians’,
in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

10 Cf. Avery Cardinal Dulles, ‘The Population of Hell’, in Avery Cardinal
Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

> God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before us, that we shall
> see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new
> heavens and the new earth, in every created thing which shall then exist;
> and also by the body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision of
> the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. (DCD XXII, 29)

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

> Certainly there was an Eden on this very unhappy earth. We all long for it,
> and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least
> corrupted, its gentlest and most humane, is still soaked with the sense of
> “exile.”

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

> The Lord is my portion;

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

"Permalink to “A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),

Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

          * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce73fb23a9bdd58d820b45b0c9bf660b?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) Fr Aidan Kimel says:

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-
is-nearer-heaven-when-in-deepest-hell-than-just-ere-he-begins-to-reap-the-
reward-of-his-doings/)

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings”](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-is-
nearer-heaven-when-in-deepest-hell-than-just-ere-he-begins-to-reap-the-reward-

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-

Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

> Good](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/09/20/when-god-becomes-jack-bauer-
> torture-hell-and-the-greater-good/)

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-
is-nearer-heaven-when-in-deepest-hell-than-just-ere-he-begins-to-reap-the-
reward-of-his-doings/)

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Transcending Freedom and Necessity").

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

9 See Marilyn Adams, ‘The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians’,
in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

_We have seen the true light!_  
_We have received the heavenly Spirit!_  
_We have found the true Faith!_  
_Worshipping the undivided Trinity,_  
_who has saved us._

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

> Christ is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation;
> for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and
> invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all
> things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in
> him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is
> the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be
> pre-eminent. For in him all the fulness of God was pleased to dwell, and
> through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in
> heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. (Col 1:15-20)

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*

man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

[← St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

> The doctrine of creation constitutes an assertion regarding the eternal
> identity of God. It is chiefly an affirmation of God’s absolute dispositive
> liberty in all his acts: the absence of any external restraint upon or
> necessity behind every decision of his will. And, while one must avoid the
> pathetic anthropomorphism of imagining God’s decision to create as an
> arbitrary choice made after deliberation among options, one must still
> affirm that it is free, that creation can add nothing to God, that God’s
> being is not dependent on the world’s, and that the only necessity in the
> divine act of creation is the impossibility of any hindrance upon God’s
> expression of his goodness. (“[God, Creation, and
> Evil](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/god-creation-and-
> evil.pdf),” p. 3; cf. this short article on [St Thomas
> Aquinas](https://jonathansmcintosh.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/summa-
> theologiae-1-19/))

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

> Since the conventional antithesis between “Neoplatonic necessary procession”
> and “Christian free creation” is a misconception, so too is any attempt to
> situate Dionysius within these categories. For Dionysius as for Plotinus,
> God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibility of not
> making does not arise. As Dionysius says, “Since, as subsistence of

> providence of the Godhead is to be hymned from all the effects … And by its
> being it is the production and origin of all things” (DN I.5, 593D; cf. DN
> IV.1, 693B). As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a “choice” on
> God’s part. But also as in Plotinus, this means not that God is subject to a

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

> We have already seen that to call the One ’cause’ in fact means only that
> all things depend on the One in order to be. It follows that the One’s
> ‘generating’ or ‘producing’ all things is nothing but the existential
> dependence of all things on the One. The One ’causes,’ ‘generates,’ or
> ‘makes’ all things only in the sense that all things depend on the One as
> the condition of integrating determination by which all beings are beings.
> This ‘making,’ therefore, must not be conceived as a change or a beginning,
> as if beings first did not exist and then are made to exist by the One:
> intelligible reality, as in Plato, is eternal in the strict sense that it is
> not temporally extended, and even the sensible cosmos, as in Aristotle, has

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

> theologiae-1-19/))

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

9 See Marilyn Adams, ‘The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians’,
in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

> The Lord is my portion;  
>  I promise to keep thy words.  
>  I entreat thy favor with all my heart;  
>  be gracious to me according to thy promise.  
>  When I think of thy ways,  
>  I turn my feet to thy testimonies;  
>  I hasten and do not delay  
>  to keep thy commandments.  
>  Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,  
>  I do not forget thy law.  
>  At midnight I rise to praise thee,  
>  because of thy righteous ordinances.  
>  I am a companion of all who fear thee,  
>  of those who keep thy precepts.  
>  The earth, O Lord, is full of thy steadfast love;  
>  teach me thy statutes! (Ps 119:57-64)

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

> A properly theological cosmology and ‘history of salvation—the economy or
> the plan of salvation—begins with the Passion of Christ, and from this
> vantage point looks backwards and forwards to see everything in this light.9

> And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I
> teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of
> the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you. (Dt 4:1)

> Certainly there was an Eden on this very unhappy earth. We all long for it,
> and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least
> corrupted, its gentlest and most humane, is still soaked with the sense of
> “exile.”

> Put another way, the solution comes first, and then we begin to understand
> where the problem lies. Christ is . . . the first principle or hypothesis

> apostle Paul draws the typological parallel: “As sin came into the world
> through one man and death through sin, so death spread to all men because
> all men sinned” (Rom 5.12). While different theories have been advanced as

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

> Mortality, in fact, seems to be regarded as natural in the Old Testament.
> There are a couple of exceptions to the normal mortality of humans—Enoch
> (Gen 5.24) and Elijah (2 Kgs 2)—but they are the exceptions which prove the
> rule. In the Old Testament, death is not ubiquitously seen as a curse or a

> in blessed terms: he “breathed his last and died in good old age, an old man
> and full of years, and was gathered to his people” (Gen 25.8). Such a death,
> surrounded by children and their children, and completed with a proper
> burial, is seen as natural and right, a completion and fulfillment, and,
> indeed, even grants the perpetuity of the deceased’s name: “The days of a
> good life are numbered, but a good name endures forever” (Sir 41.13).2

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and

if we chose to reject them.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

anyway-why-not-deify-everyone-immediately/>

of-evil-2/>

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

> Again, as we climb higher we say this. It is not soul or mind, nor does it
> possess imagination, conviction, speech, or understanding. Nor is it speech
> per se, understanding per se. It cannot be spoken of and it cannot be

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

> Think of how it is with our sun. It exercises no rational process, no act of
> choice, and yet by the very fact of its existence it gives light to whatever
> is able to partake of its light, in its own way. So it is with the Good.

> sends the rays of its undivided goodness to everything with the capacity,

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

possible/ "Permalink to St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny:
Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

[12] Panteleimon Manoussakis, “[St. Augustine and St. Maximus the Confessor
between the Beginning and the
End](https://www.academia.edu/28215430/St._Augustine_and_St._Maximus_the_Confessor_between_the_Beginning_and_the_End),”
_Studia Patristica_ 15 (2017): 8-9.

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

> Certainly there was an Eden on this very unhappy earth. We all long for it,
> and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least
> corrupted, its gentlest and most humane, is still soaked with the sense of
> “exile.”

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

_Christ is risen from the dead,_  
_Trampling down death by death,_  
_And upon those in the tombs_  
_Bestowing life!_

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

> Put another way, the solution comes first, and then we begin to understand

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

> A necessary truth is one that could not have been otherwise. It would have

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

Own Necessity").

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

10 Cf. Avery Cardinal Dulles, ‘The Population of Hell’, in Avery Cardinal
Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

_We have seen the true light!_  
_We have received the heavenly Spirit!_  
_We have found the true Faith!_  
_Worshipping the undivided Trinity,_  
_who has saved us._

> The years of our life are threescore and ten,  
>  or even by reason of strength fourscore;  
>  yet their span is but toil and trouble;  
>  they are soon gone, and we fly away. (Ps 90:10)

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

> For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you,
> neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will
> go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?”
> Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea
> for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?” But the word is
> very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.

echoes-of-eden-2/ "Permalink to The Christ, the Fall, and Echoes of Eden").

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

[St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible? →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-
augustine-on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-
possible/)

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

between the Beginning and the
End](https://www.academia.edu/28215430/St._Augustine_and_St._Maximus_the_Confessor_between_the_Beginning_and_the_End),”
_Studia Patristica_ 15 (2017): 8-9.

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/if-god-is-going-to-deify-everyone-
anyway-why-not-deify-everyone-immediately/>  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/creation-theodicy-and-the-problem-
of-evil-2/>

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Transcending Freedom and Necessity").

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

> liberty in all his acts: the absence of any external restraint upon or
> necessity behind every decision of his will. And, while one must avoid the

> Aquinas](https://jonathansmcintosh.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/summa-
> theologiae-1-19/))

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

9 See Marilyn Adams, ‘The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians’,
in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

10 Cf. Avery Cardinal Dulles, ‘The Population of Hell’, in Avery Cardinal
Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

> strengths and weaknesses, it must never be forgotten that the basis for this

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

> And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I
> teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

> A necessary truth is one that could not have been otherwise. It would have
> been true under all circumstances. A contin­gent truth is one that is true,
> but could have been false. A necessary truth is one that must be true; a
> contin­gent truth is one that is true as it happens, or as things are, but
> that did not have to be true. In Leibniz’s phrase, a necessary truth is true
> in all possible worlds. If these are all the worlds that accord with the
> principles of logic, however different they may be otherwise, then the truth
> is a logically necessary truth. If they cover all the worlds whose
> metaphysics is possible, then the proposition is metaphysically necessary.
> If a proposition is only true in all the worlds that are physically
> possible, then the proposition is true of physical necessity.1

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

“God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us”  
Nobody is saying this. You are simply either refusing to listen to anything
said to you or out-and-out lying. How is it possible for an apparently
intelligent man dealing honestly to derive this statement from “God would not
do otherwise than save a person who would otherwise eternally suffer because
God is good.”? There is no connection between the two statements. You must
know this, you have been told this repeatedly, and yet just mindlessly repeat
the same lie: why?

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as

101.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

          * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a8385e40fc2827dafd1c87470970e04?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) David says:

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

[← St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.

In love he will be all in all.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

          * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a8385e40fc2827dafd1c87470970e04?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) David says:

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

anyway-why-not-deify-everyone-immediately/>  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/creation-theodicy-and-the-problem-
of-evil-2/>

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-
is-nearer-heaven-when-in-deepest-hell-than-just-ere-he-begins-to-reap-the-

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

“God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us”  
Nobody is saying this. You are simply either refusing to listen to anything
said to you or out-and-out lying. How is it possible for an apparently
intelligent man dealing honestly to derive this statement from “God would not
do otherwise than save a person who would otherwise eternally suffer because
God is good.”? There is no connection between the two statements. You must
know this, you have been told this repeatedly, and yet just mindlessly repeat
the same lie: why?

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

[5] Julie Swanstrom, “[Avicenna’s Account of Creation by Divine Voluntary
Emanation](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/aviccenac2b4s-julie-
swanstrom.pdf),” _Otrosiglo_ 1 (2017): 115-116.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

[← St Augustine on the ‘Last Things’ and Human Destiny: Is Eschatological
Universalism Possible?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/st-augustine-
on-the-last-things-and-human-destiny-is-eschatological-universal-possible/)

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

anyway-why-not-deify-everyone-immediately/>  
<https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/creation-theodicy-and-the-problem-
of-evil-2/>

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

[7] Katherin Rogers, “[Anselm on God’s Perfect
Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is
without difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal,
conscious torment.”

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine

101.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

> God exists _a se_ , He cannot fail to do what is best, and in _Cur deus
> homo_ , the conclusion is that, since only a God-man can effect the
> completion of the work God started with the creation of man, God ‘must’

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

“God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us”  
Nobody is saying this. You are simply either refusing to listen to anything
said to you or out-and-out lying. How is it possible for an apparently
intelligent man dealing honestly to derive this statement from “God would not
do otherwise than save a person who would otherwise eternally suffer because
God is good.”? There is no connection between the two statements. You must
know this, you have been told this repeatedly, and yet just mindlessly repeat
the same lie: why?

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

By the Dionysian apprehension of divinity, we affirm, we deny, we deny the
denial. We are thus brought before the “preeminently simple and absolute
nature,” before which we must be silent in our unknowing. We can no more say
“God freely makes choices” than “God necessarily makes choices.” Both are
true, both are false, both are hidden in the darkness of the ineffable
Trinity. With Bradshaw I too wish to affirm the divine freedom and the
nonnecessity of creation, and it’s hard for me to imagine Denys not also
affirming both. But I suspect he would also tell us that we are here
confronted with an aporia that metaphysics—Neoplatonic, Thomist, Palamite, or
otherwise—cannot solve. The theological tradition clearly discerns that the
agapeic origin of being entails that the world need not have been, despite
philosophical misgivings to the contrary (see “[The Christian
Distinction](//afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/god-world-≠-2/)“). Reason bows
before the gospel. The following statement by David Bentley Hart faithfully
expresses the Dionysian view:

The Sun and its rays is a favorite Neoplatonic metaphor for the One and its
emanating processions; it is not surprising that Dionysius should also favor
it. The first couple of sentences jump out at us: “no rational process,” “no
act of choice.” The sun does not personally decide to radiate, it just does;
it’s what suns do. But are we to infer on the basis of a metaphor that
Dionysius also conceived divine creation as _necessitated_? Given that he is
writing for a Christian audience, a monk for monks, it seems more likely that
he anticipated that his fellow monks would not jump to a pagan conclusion. The
impersonal radiation may reasonably be interpreted as bespeaking the fidelity
of God in his self-communication and grace. Metaphor is not theory. Moreover,
in this particular passage Dionysius is focusing on angelic intelligences who
are expected both to _freely_ share their gifts with lesser beings and to
_freely_ return to God in praise and obedience. Is the One less personal, less
free than the rational beings he creates?

Bradshaw challenges Perl’s contention that the disjunctive proposition “either
God chooses between possible alternatives or he is necessitated to create”
subjects God to a higher condition. What if the possibility of choice is
intrinsic to the divine nature, as presumably it must be since God determines
what gets created and what doesn’t? “Certainly the framework of possibilities
is prior to the act of choice, in the sense of being presupposed by it,” he
states; “this does not mean that it is prior to God Himself, for it is already
implicit in the divine nature” (p. 9). Bradshaw’s objection raises an
interesting metaphysical question about possible beings and how God judges
which to actualize. Denys may even be aware of the problem: “The divine name
‘Good’ tells of all the processions of the universal Cause; it extends to
beings and nonbeings and that Cause is superior to being and nonbeings” ( _DN_
V.1). What are these nonbeings? possibles that will never be created?
possibles that have yet to be created but will be? Does it even make sense to
speak of possibles “before” the act of creation? In any case, the objection
misses the point. If the One is truly beyond being, as the Neoplatonists
insist, it surpasses the either/or duality of freedom and necessity. Even talk
about a “divine nature” becomes problematic, as the Areopagite makes clear in
the concluding chapter of his _Mystical Theology_ :

Bradshaw helpfully suggests that we might think of the divine freedom along
the lines of “the free expression of a creative intent” (p. 11). When an
artist sits down to paint a landscape, he may not in fact be making a
deliberative choice between discrete possibilities. He is just painting,
sponta­neously, extemporaneously, improvisationally, in the fullness of
freedom. At this point Bradshaw and Perl may be closer than they realize. Perl
again:

Perl’s logic here is difficult and counter-intuitive, I admit, yet it seems to
follow from the Dionysian apprehension of divinity as [beyond-beingly
being](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/dionysian-ponderings-beyond-
the-beyond-and-then-beyond/). God is not a being; he is no-being, no-thing.
Hence he does not first exist as a something which then acts; he is his act,
the act of imparting being to beings, nothing but act:

Yet here we _are_. How? Why? Plotinus says that finite reality exists “by
necessity,” but Perl warns that this does not mean what we usually take it to
mean. Given that God is not subject to anything other than himself, and given
that he exists in asymmetrical relation to beings (beings participate the One;
he does not participate beings), then the fact that beings do exist means that
no other alternative obtains. God is the unconditioned enabling condition for
the existence of anything and everything. He is the metaphysical reason why
the world exists rather than nothing. As Dionysius puts it: “by merely being
there is the cause of everything” ( _DN_ I.5). If it were possible for God to
have decided not to create a universe, writes Perl, then that would entail
that “his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be
conditioned by a relation to his product. Only a God who is not a producer but
Production itself can ‘produce’ without entering into a relation with his
products. The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation
on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting
condition whatsoever” (p. 50). The counterfactual, we might say, is excluded
by the fact that the world does exist. Given the simplicity and immutability
of the Creator, it isn’t a logical possibility. As [Dennis
Bonnette](https://strangenotions.com/god-eternity-free-will-and-the-world/)
comments: “What is _de facto_ metaphysically impossible renders the
alternative ‘logical possibilities’ not logically possible at all, except as
contrary-to-reality mental imaginings. That is, _they are not actually real
possibilities at all_.”

Perhaps the answer to our question lies in the infinite creativity and love
that is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Perl believes that Dionysius is best interpreted along such a Neoplatonic
line. The One is not a godlet who deliberates among possibilities and then
chooses to overflow into differentiated finitude. In eternal self-
determination he is overflowing itself, the agapeic gifting of being. “God as
the Good itself,” comments Ficino, “creates by His own pure existence, that
is, by his goodness” _(_ I:287). That the transcendent Creator is neither an
ontic entity nor celestial manager compels this strange way of talking. The
radicality of the Dionysian vision turns our metaphysical world upside down.
For this reason, suggests Perl, the question “Did the Lord God Almighty _have_
to create the world?” is meaningless. Its mere posing reveals that one has
misunderstood:

![](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/universe-4-winds.jpg?w=591&h=912)“There
is no evidence in the Dionysian corpus of _creatio ex nihilo_ ,” avers Timothy
D. Knepper; “rather, the divine names, the properties they source, and the
beings that participate in them, all preexist in and process from God” ([
_Negating
Negation_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625642504/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN25642504&linkIdT2e74cc6c60e2f24c447524f5fbc40b),
p. 26). The statement immediately raises the question, why does _creatio ex
nihilo_ exclude the divine names and processions? Unfortunately, Knepper does
not explain. As we saw in an [earlier
article](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/06/24/dionysian-ponderings-
plotinian-emanation-and-the-creatio-ex-nihilo/), Plotinus advances a doctrine
of emanation that approximates the classical Christian view: pre-existing
matter is rejected by both; both assert the absolute ontological dependence of
beings upon the One. Behind Knepper’s negative verdict on the _creatio ex
nihilo_ lies the Areopagite’s fondness for impersonal imagery ( _cause_ ,
_source_ , _flow-over_ , _bubble-over_ ). The biblical depiction of the
personal Creator bringing the cosmos to reality by will and command seems to
be relatively absent. Occasionally, though, one will come across a statement
like this: “To sum up. It is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and Cause of all life and of all being, for out of its goodness
it commands all things to be and it keeps them going” ([ _The Divine
Names_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809128381/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN09128381&linkIdf3d2e2ffeffa1b98578dc3599723b3)
I.3). The predominance of impersonal imagery leads Knepper to conclude that
for St Dionysius the emanational act “seems to be necessary or ‘automatic'”
(p. 26, n. 65). Knepper is not alone. Other scholars have reached similar
conclusions. Hence the question I wish to explore in this article: Did the
Lord God Almighty _have_ to create the world?

Posted on [14 July 2018](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/ "6:43 am") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr

I personally find Perl’s reading of Dionysius compelling. It seems to rhyme
with the radical sense of divine transcendence that the Areopagite articulates
throughout his writings. But David Bradshaw is unconvinced. He believes that
Dionysius is best read as standing within the tradition of the Greek Fathers:
“In light of the apparent unanimity of this tradition regarding divine choice
it would be odd if Dionysius were so thoroughly out of step” (“[Divine Freedom
in the Greek Fathers](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-
freedom-in-greek-fathers.pdf),” p. 6). I agree. How else can we explain the
reception of the _Corpus Areopagaticum_ into the life of the Church? Yet this
does not mean that Dionysius has not brought something new to the apophatic
table, something that might change the way we think about a difficult
theological problem. I’m thinking here of the Neoplatonic _hyperousios_. It’s
one thing to say that the divine essence is incompre­hensible; it’s another
thing to identify God as beyond being, beyond existing, beyond unity and
difference. This move introduces a deeper level of metaphysical analysis. One
does not need to be a patristics scholar to observe the significant
differences between Denys and, say, St Athanasius. If we were able to
interview the two theologians and pose to them the question of divine freedom,
might they not give different answers? Why shouldn’t they? I can imagine
Dionysius muttering: “Weren’t you listening? How many _hyper-_ prefixes do I
need to add?” I suspect Athanasius would find all of this as metaphysically
perplexing as we do.

Eric Perl believes that the question of divine freedom has been misformulated.
It hiddenly presupposes the belief that God is a finite substance and person
confronted with the choice to create or not create:

As embodied beings living in time, we know all about choices and decisions.
Should I get out of bed this morning? Should I make myself a hearty breakfast,
as all mothers tell us we should, or will I skip it, as I usually do? Each day
we are confronted with innumerable possible courses of action. Each decision
contributes to our well-being or ill-being. As Marsilio Ficino remarks: “Human
reason acts by deliberation and subsequent to deliberation by choosing” _([On
Dionysius the
Areopagite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674058356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&creative25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN74058356&linkIdc93fe448d9213e296972c213596378)_,
I:285-287). But now try to imagine the counterfactual of the supra-essential
Deity choosing to make a universe that does not “yet” exist. He does not
inhabit time but the realm of eternity. There are no other beings for him to
worry about. There is literally nothing else but God in the infinite plenitude
of his “beyond be-ing beyond-beingly before all” ( _DN_ V.8) _._ He doesn’t
need to do anything to add to his happiness. In the simplicity of his
Trinitarian life, the Father possesses with his Son and Spirit unlimited
happiness and joy, bliss and delight. He doesn’t have any places to visit. He
doesn’t have to make a living. He doesn’t need friends. He doesn’t have an
aging grandparent to care for. He doesn’t require anything outside himself to
express his infinite creativity. Does the notion of choice even make sense in
this scenario? It’s hard to see how it does. Our finite categories of freedom
and necessity do not apply. God’s existence, or more accurately his hyper-
existence, cannot be described as necessity; for there is no principle or
power above him that can subject, coerce, or constrain him. He is thus
radically and surpassingly free, free in a way we cannot imagine. The Deity of
Dionysius is the source of creaturely freedoms and necessities yet transcends
both in supra-essential unity.

Excellent post Father. The last quote from Dionysius in the final excerpt from
Perl really struck me: “Love…preexisting in excess in the Good did not permit
it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to production..,” But Love
is also the perichoretic relation between the Persons of the Holy Trinity. God
does not need the world because of the Love within the immanent Trinity. Yet
this very same Love moves God to create the world. This stuff is exceptionally
difficult but you did a great job of presenting the Areopagite’s take on this
clearly.

3 Cf. J. N. D. Kelly, _Early Christian Doctrines_ , 5th edn (London: A&C
Black, 1977), pp. 361-366

Hence, the ultimate goal of the city of God with its comparatively few
inhabitants and the transformed world is the ‘perpetual Sabbath’, an eternal
state beyond temporal succession in perfect communion with God: ‘There we
shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in
the end without end’ (DCD XXII, 30).

7 See, for instance, DH 4140 (Heinrich Denzinger, _Enchiridion symbolorum
definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum_ , ed. by Peter
Hünermann, 43th edn [Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 2010]).

The souls of the dead await the resurrection of their bodies as the dividing
line between time and eternity. God’s elected will share in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ and be fully ‘conformed to the image of the Son’ (Rom 8:29),
which means a complete deification by adoption.4 For Augustine, there is an
identity between the bodies on earth and the risen bodies; however, the risen
body is a ‘spiritual body’ (see DCD XXII, 21). The eternal beatitude of the
saints, which exceeds all our greatest imaginations, consists in praising God
and their beatific vision of God:

12 See for this approach and the consequential eschatological insights: Peter
Knauer, _Der Glaube kommt vom Hören: Ökumenische Fundamentaltheologie_ , 7th
edn. (Norderstedt: BoD, 2015), especially pp. 167-184.

Hope in the theological sense is not hypothetical because in faith there is no
area of uncertainty. So it’s not mere “hopeful universalism” in the usual
sense.

5 Cf., for instance, Darrin S. Snyder Belousek, _Atonement, Justice and Peace:
The Message of the Cross and the Mission of the Church_ (Grand Rapids,
MI/Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 41-45.

I always wondered what the meaning is of the distinction that is made between
hope and faith, especially in the context of the question of universalism.
Perhaps it is a way to keep it from being dogmatically asserted and keep the
baddies from Rome at bay? Believe certainly is stronger than hope (I believe
in God while I hope it will rain next week), although one can believe and hope
in the same (I believe and hope in God) so they are not opposed. There seems
to be more at play though, maybe not in the case of Balthasar, but I’m getting
a different vibe from Fr Rooney. One may not and cannot believe in the
salvation of all.

6 For a critical discussion of the ‘problem of hell’ in general (and also
regarding the Augustinian view) see, for instance, C. P. Ragland, ‘Hell’, in
[_Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy_](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hell/), and
Thomas Talbott, ‘Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought’, [_The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/)
(both accessed 18/1/2016).

In this essay, I am going to outline some basic aspects of Augustinian
eschatology and identify its problems. What is the ultimate destiny of the
human race according to St. Augustine? Was Augustine right in rejecting all
forms of eschatological universalism? What are the alternatives? My main
thesis is that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s universal saving
will and that his view of original sin with its consequential theory of
retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular version of
eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for Catholic
theology.

Is Eschatological Universalism Possible?").

Firstly, I shall outline the main lines of Augustine’s view on the ‘last
things’ and human destiny, that is to say, Augustine’s eschatology. Secondly,
I shall critically discuss it and propose an alternative eschatological model.
Thirdly, I shall end by giving a brief conclusion.

4 David Vincent Meconi, _The One Christ: St. Augustine’s Theology of
Deification_ (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press,
2015), argues, against the mainstream interpretation, that deification plays a
central role in Augustine’s theology: Augustine talks at times ‘about becoming
divinely adopted sons and daughters, while at other times he will present the
goal of Christianity as “becoming gods”, or becoming a member of the whole
Christ ( _Christus totus_ ), or even as becoming Christ himself’ (p. xii).

Augustine’s eschatology, with its implicit theory of double predestination,
was never fully accepted by the Catholic Church, who emphasized and emphasizes
the role of free will and the idea of a co-operation with grace in the process
of salvation. Where could one identify problems in Augustine’s approach? In
the given context, I would like to focus on two aspects.6

Original sin is primarily an ontological reality (although it unfolds massive
moral consequences): due to the fact that the relation between the created
world and God is completely unilateral,14 no created quality, and no human
act, since even our freest acts are created, can grant communion with God who
‘dwells in unapproachable light’ (cf. 1 Tim 6:16). Communion with God and
participating in His eternal life is but possible in this way: God relates to
the world with the same love in which He relates to His Son from all eternity.
He does not become dependent on the world by His love for it and His love for
the world is of divine nature, unchanging, unconditional and eternal. Being
loved by God in this way is the deepest reality of the whole world and of
every single human being; however, this deepest reality is supernatural and
accessible only by faith in the word of God.

1 See, for instance, [_The City of
God_](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm); further references to this
work are provided in parenthesis in the text.

_The Rev. Dr. Dr. Robert Deinhammer, S.J. (born 1977) is an Austrian Jesuit
and currently living in Innsbruck. He has been working at the Universities of
Salzburg and Innsbruck. His academic working fields are normative ethics and
philosophy of religion. He considers himself as a catholic universalist._

In this essay, I have outlined some basic aspects of Augustinian eschatology.
My main thesis has been that Augustine’s approach does not consider God’s
universal saving will and that his view of original sin with its consequential
theory of retributive punishment is problematic. In my view, a particular
version of eschatological universalism could be an acceptable position for
Catholic theology.

Augustine addresses objections against his view of hell as an eternal
punishment and defends his anti-universalist eschatology, for instance, in DCD
XXI, 17 to 27. His arguments are very much based on a certain interpretation
of the relevant bible passages: time-limited and purifying suffering in hell
would contradict Holy Scripture (e.g. Mt 25:41-46; Rev 20:10; 2 Pet 2:4) and
undermine the eternal blessedness of the saints in heaven. ‘Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of
those who are doomed to it shall have no end’ (DCD XXI, 23).

Seen from this perspective, the threats of hell in the New Testament, which
cannot be denied, mean that, outside of the Holy Spirit, God is absent for all
eternity and that every attempt to reach salvation by idolising created
realities, i.e. by sinning, is ultimately hopeless. Seen from outside of
faith, there are no grounds for any hope. But God’s absence is overcome by
Jesus Christ in the sense that He reveals God’s presence and love for faith.
By faith, man is liberated from the power of fear for oneself and empowered to
cooperate with God’s grace in performing truly good works. The Christian faith
is the beginning of our eternal life already here and now. And only within
this faith can we have hope that God’s mercy will be the final word for all
human beings: God will separate the sinner from his or her sin, although we
cannot know the mechanism: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that
he may be merciful to all’ (Rom 11:32).

14 See, for instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ , I q13 a7.

Secondly, Augustine’s view of original sin and its consequential theory of
hell as a retributive punishment seems to be problematic. Is the traditional
historic understanding of Adam’s fall and the Augustinian view of original sin
convincing? Be that as it may, most people are not, according to Augustine, in
a state of grace; hence, they are not really free to perform good works. Sin
is not an expression of true freedom; it is rather slavery and paralysis. But
then the notion of hell as retributive punishment becomes problematic, for
retributive punishment presupposes freedom and responsibility. Furthermore,
the idea of inherited personal guilt seems to be contradictory. Additionally,
one could ask whether any sin that a finite being commits in a situation of
ambiguity and (relative) ignorance deserves an infinite punishment as a just
retribution.9 And wouldn’t it be possible to say that real justice requires
not so much punishment but rather reconciliation and restoration? At any rate,
human beings have a strong tendency towards revenge, and sometimes they
project this tendency on God. St. Augustine was not free from human flaws.

Despite his Neoplatonism and due to his increasing familiarity with Holy
Scripture, Augustine discovers the importance of a historic understanding of
the world and favours a linear model of history. His view is dramatic in the
sense that he conceives human history as integrated in the wider context of an
eschatological drama, in which history is the temporal playing out of God’s
justice and in which both beginning and (eternal) end are fixed.2 Due to
original sin, in which all human beings have sinned in Adam (cf. Rom 5:12) and
participate in his fall, the whole of humanity has turned away from God and
has become a _massa damnata_ , a ‘lump’ that justly deserves the punishment of
eternal damnation (see DCD XIII, 14; XIV, 3 and 13; XXI, 12).3 Nevertheless,
God has chosen or predestined by means of a free and utterly unmerited grace a
small minority of this ‘lump’ in order to grant them salvation and
participation in His own eternal life. For Augustine, the number of the
elected is very small so that God can show what in fact all deserve and
enforce His Divine justice (see DCD XXI, 12). God’s elected belong to the
‘city of God’ (the visible Church has a special relation to it) and are able
to lead a life of faith, charity and worship. But the vast majority belongs to
the ‘city of Man’ and is trapped in an unfree, self-centred and sinful
existence. In this life, however, no one can be sure whether he or she is in
fact chosen by God (see, for instance, DCD XIV, 28; XX, 9 and 27). Human
history is ambiguous and one cannot foresee its ending; however, there will be
an eschatological separation of the two cities, namely a collective judgement
and transformation of the world at the end of time (see DCD XX, 21 and 28).

10 Cf. Avery Cardinal Dulles, ‘The Population of Hell’, in Avery Cardinal
Dulles, _Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures_ , 1988-2007
(New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 387-400.

9 See Marilyn Adams, ‘The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians’,
in _A Reasoned Faith_ , ed. by Eleonore Stump (Ithaca/New York: Cornell
University Press, 1993), pp. 301-327 (p. 313).

But is eschatological universalism an acceptable option for Catholic theology?
A non-universalist eschatology was, more or less, taken for granted up to the
paradigm shift from eschatological pessimism to optimism in the 20th
Century.10 Nowadays, the main argument in favour of the possibility of eternal
hell goes like this: God respects our free will and does not force us into
heaven, hence, the possibility of hell is an implication of human freedom.11
This view does not imply that one has to believe that many or some human
beings will, in fact, end up in hell. Thus, universalism – with regard to
human beings – is at least possible. Is this view convincing? God’s grace and
love has to be revealed to us by the word, coming from Jesus, the incarnate
Son, since it cannot be identified by natural reason. Without Jesus Christ and
his message we would not know that we are from the outset created into the
Triune Life, i.e. into the eternal love between the Father and the Son, which
is the Holy Spirit.12 However, there is no ‘neutral freedom’ vis-á-vis God’s
grace, which is offered and communicated in His word, i.e. the Christian
message. One can only recognise God’s grace by embracing the Christian message
in an act of faith. Outside of faith, one cannot recognise the truth of the
Christian message; that is to say, one is able to reject the Christian message
by becoming arbitrary, but it is not possible to reject it in fully knowing
that it is in fact God’s word, i.e. God’s self- communication in a human
word.13

8 See Robert Deinhammer, ‘Reductio in Unum Mysterium: Fundamentaltheologische
Erwägungen im Kontext ignatianischer Spiritualität’, _Theologie und Glaube_ ,
101 (2011), 539-561 (pp. 545-552).

Firstly, Augustine denies the universality of God’s saving will. From a
Catholic point of view, God does not want the salvation of only a small
minority of human beings. He intends the salvation of all. To be sure, the
Catholic Church is God’s instrument of salvation in communicating His
uncreated grace, i.e. the Holy Spirit, to the world; however, the Church
teaches that all people can be saved, no matter whether they are Christians or
not.7 Augustine’s exegesis of the relevant bible passages seems to be
debatable, especially if one asks the important but rarely posed question:
What is the possible content of Divine revelation? God does not reveal
information about created states of affairs or future events but reveals His
presence in the sense that he gives a share in His own Trinitarian life.
Whether many or some people will end up in hell is no possible content of
revelation, hence, no object of faith, if one conceives revelation strictly as
God’s self-communication in Jesus Christ. All articles of faith explain but
this basic mystery and can be reduced to it.8 On this view, Holy Scripture is
not the word of God in an arbitrary or biblicistic sense but only insofar as
it can be consistently understood as God’s word when faced with God’s utter
transcendence and absoluteness (see below).

13 John Finnis, ‘Hell and Hope’, in John Finnis, _The Collected Essays of John
Finnis_ : Vol. V: _Religion and Public Reasons_ (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2013), pp. 368-379, does not sufficiently realise that there is no
‘neutral freedom’ with regard to God’s grace in the above sense. He neither
poses the question regarding the possible content of supernatural revelation.

Fr Deinhammer, thank you for this article. Your argument regarding
universalism sounds very Lutheran, which does not surprise. German Catholic
theologians have enjoyed substantive ecumenical discussions with German
Lutheran theologians for over a half-century now. Are you acquainted with the
writings of the Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson? Your piece reminds me of
his discussion of hell. See: <https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/hell-
freedom-and-the-predestinating-gospel/>.

11 See, for instance, _Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church_
(London: Catholic Trust Society, 2006), pp. 70.

St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential theologians in
the history of the Latin Church. His eschatology is intertwined with his
theology of history, his theology of grace including the doctrine of original
sin, and is, of course, dependent on his philosophical-theological
presuppositions in general. In the following lines, I am going to outline some
basic aspects of Augustine’s eschatology as found in his late major work _De
Civitate Dei_ (= DCD), written between 413 and 427.1

The overwhelming majority of the human race, the non-elect, will not be so
lucky. There will also be a resurrection of their bodies, however, a
resurrection in order to judge – Jesus Christ is the judge – and punish them
(including those who die in infancy) with everlasting damnation, a
resurrection to the second death. Augustine conceives hell as a retributive
punishment by God, and for him, hell is eternal because original sin is such a
horrendous offence against God. Eternal punishment in hell is an expression of
God’s justice (see DCD XXI, 12).5 The bodies of the damned will be endlessly
tortured by burning in hellfire but, by a miracle of their Creator, without
being consumed by its flames (see DCD XXI, 2; 3; 4; 9), although the degree of
torment is proportionate to the extent of personal sin, ‘whether this result
be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself,
graduated according to every one’s merit, or whether it be that the heat
remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment’
(DCD XXI, 16).

2 See Rüdiger Bittner, ‘Augustine’s Philosophy of History’, in _The
Augustinian Tradition_ , ed. by Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley/Los
Angeles/London: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 345-360 (p. 348)

Death as a metaphysical surd and enemy seems to be largely missing in the Old
Testament. Men and women are mortal. Death is the natural conclusion of an
existence that is hard and full of sorrow:

> Mortality, in fact, seems to be regarded as natural in the Old Testament.
> There are a couple of exceptions to the normal mortality of humans—Enoch
> (Gen 5.24) and Elijah (2 Kgs 2)—but they are the exceptions which prove the
> rule. In the Old Testament, death is not ubiquitously seen as a curse or a
> punishment for sin. In fact, the death of figures such as Abraham, whose
> lives are of significance for the unfolding of the narrative, are described
> in blessed terms: he “breathed his last and died in good old age, an old man
> and full of years, and was gathered to his people” (Gen 25.8). Such a death,
> surrounded by children and their children, and completed with a proper
> burial, is seen as natural and right, a completion and fulfillment, and,
> indeed, even grants the perpetuity of the deceased’s name: “The days of a
> good life are numbered, but a good name endures forever” (Sir 41.13).2

Orthodox readers will be surprised by Behr’s openness to a Latin reading of
Romans 5:12 (Vulgate: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and
by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”).
Over the past many decades Orthodox apologists have stridently advanced their
interpretation of _eph ho_ (“because” rather than “in whom”) as a point of
church-dividing difference, as if early Latin translators could not possibly
have had plausible reasons for their reading. Behr thinks too much has been
made of a single phrase: “Reading _eph o_ as meaning ‘because _of death_ ,’
makes the pronoun play too many roles: it cannot, together with the
preposition, be a contraction, meaning ‘because,’ and also refer back to
‘death,’ to say that ‘because of death all men have sinned.’ The verse simply
says that death has still spread to all _because_ all have sinned.”8 I will
leave the exegetical debate to those who know their Koine Greek. Behr is not
endorsing an Augustinian doctrine of corporate guilt. He is, rather, exhorting
us to read the entirety of Scripture through the Crucified:

And when the people sin, God has generously provided the way of repentance and
sacrifice. Jewish scholars have long told us that the conception of YHWH as a
deity who imposes unfulfillable commandments in order to teach his people the
depth of their sinfulness is a figment of Christian imagination. As the great
Jewish scholar Claude Montefiore wrote back at the turn of the 20th century:

> God to the Rabbis is certainly both Lawgiver and Judge, and even the Pauline
> Christian recognizes that there is such a thing as justice and judgment both
> in this world and in the next. But how can you call that Lawgiver stern and

> ceaseless in his love for them, who pities them in their sorrows, and on the
> smallest pretext of repentance hastens to forgive them their sins?3

Sin is no longer understood as a violation of Torah (or at least not simply as
such) but more deeply as existence “‘in Adam’ rather than ‘in Christ,’ and the
whole human race ‘in Adam,’ without Christ, can be described in St Augustine’s
phrase as ‘one mass of sin,’ without implying a pessimistic view of humanity:
it is the precondition of needing Christ, who comes to ‘call the righteous,
but the sinners’ (Mt 9.13).”6 Those who have read E. P. Sanders’s [_Paul and
Palestinian Judaism_](https://amzn.to/3UcoFjO) will immediately recognize the
thesis: Paul does not begin with an analysis of the human condition and then
proceed to offer Jesus as its solution. He begins with the crucified and risen
Jesus and then apprehends all of reality through him. As Sanders puts it,
Paul’s assessment of the plight of humanity is a “reflex of his soteriology.”7

> And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I
> teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of

Even more embarrassing to traditional catechesis is the Old Testament
presentation of covenantal righteousness and obedience. The commandments are
delivered to Israel with the understanding that they are the way of life and
therefore doable. In the words of Moses:

Echoes of Eden reverber­ate throughout the stories of Scripture. St Maximus
the Confessor provides the necessary demythologization: at the “very instant”
Adam was created, he subjected himself to sensible things, thus corrupting his
natural desire of God.10 The fall of man was instantaneous with his creation.
In Behr’s words: “There never was a ‘time,’ for Maxi­mus, in which human
beings did not stand in need of Christ.”11 This positing of humanity’s embrace
of autonomy at the moment of its creation, as Fr Panteleimon Manoussakis
elaborates, “allows him [Maximus] to avoid the problems of a (historical) time
of perfection, while distinguishing between creation as created and creation
as fallen, or put differently, between creation as being and creation as the
theater of human action.”12 This distinction does not solve the aporia of
evil, but perhaps it allows us to refocus our attention on Pascha as the
foundation of theology. The end is given in the beginning; protology becomes
eschatology. Manoussakis continues:

The traditional construal makes perfectly good sense and has well served the
Church, but it has its problems. First of all, it seems to contradict what we
might call the “plain” reading of the Old Testament. The biblical writers are,
of course, well acquainted with the horror of death—how could they not be?—but
they do not explain it by appeal to the original sin of the Edenic couple.
Adam and Eve are presented as mortal beings who were given the opportu­nity to
attain immortality yet by disobedience failed. Even so, the biblical writers
appear to view death as a normal occurrence. As Fr John Behr notes:

_Christ is risen from the dead,_  
_Trampling down death by death,_  
_And upon those in the tombs_  
_Bestowing life!_

It begins with the Fall and the introduc­tion of death and corrup­tion into
the good world God has made. The ancient story is inscribed upon our hearts.
Tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, plunge into a
state of shame, alienation, and mortality, and are expelled from paradise.
Cardinal Newman famously articulated the Christian intuition: “If there is a
God, since there is a God, the human race is implicated in some terrible
_aboriginal calamity_. It is out of joint with the purposes of its Creator.
This is a fact, a fact as true as the fact of its existence.”1 For our
purposes, the precise nature of the original sin, as well as the mechanics of
its transmission, is of only secondary import. What is critical is the
impossibility of return, both for Adam and Eve and for us. Our eyes have been
opened. We have lost our innocence and are trapped in a world of violence,
wickedness, and sin. The way to the tree of life is barred by cherubim and
flaming sword. The Fall is thus presented as historical event, one which might
be dated on a timeline, if we possessed sufficient data. After the Edenic
debacle, God launches his plan of salvation, beginning with the call of
Abraham and the making of covenant; continuing with Israel and Torah,
prophets, priests, and kings; culminating in the death and resurrection of the
eternal Son and the outpouring of the Spirit. It’s all quite linear, moving
from one day to the next under the providential governance of the Creator.

[12] Panteleimon Manoussakis, “[St. Augustine and St. Maximus the Confessor
between the Beginning and the
End](https://www.academia.edu/28215430/St._Augustine_and_St._Maximus_the_Confessor_between_the_Beginning_and_the_End),”
_Studia Patristica_ 15 (2017): 8-9.

The question of the Fall raises multiple difficulties for moderns. Given all
that we know both about the universe (cosmology) and the development of life
on our planet (evolu­tionary biology), how do we properly interpret the
catholic claim that God is not the author of death? Why do reptiles and
animals suffer and die when they appeared in history so much earlier than man?
Lions eat lambs, sheep eat clover and forbs—they would not thrive if they did
not. The good of one is achieved at the expense of an other. Life con­sumes
life. Behr does not address questions like this, and I imagine he might well
remind us that the Fall is neither a historical nor scientific claim. We
confess the ancestral sin in faith as a truth of divine revelation. Only
through the cross do we see the obscenity of death; only through Pascha do we
apprehend death as a metaphysical catastrophe that should not be.

By the death and resurrec­tion of Christ, we now know that which we could not
other­wise have known: death is the enemy of mankind. In Adam we are its
prisoners, dead in our sins and trespasses; but in Christ we are now
victorious, raised unto eternal life.

We only look for an answer when we are confronted with a quandary. But in the
Apostle’s case it was the other way round. As a zealous persecutor of the
Jesus sect, Rabbi Saul knew that Torah had been given to the Jews as the way
of life and sanctity. He did not need the gospel the apostate Christians were
proclaiming. He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have
been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the
risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside-
down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the
general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand
why. The Apostle had been introduced to the solution; he now needed to
identify the existential problem:

_We have seen the true light!_  
_We have received the heavenly Spirit!_  
_We have found the true Faith!_  
_Worshipping the undivided Trinity,_  
_who has saved us._

Death is also metaphorically identified as a power that challenges and
threatens man: “The cords of death encompassed me,” bemoans the psalmist, “the
torrents of perdition assailed me” (Ps 18:4). Perhaps the closest we come to
Christian sensibility is found in the Wisdom of Solomon: “For God created man
for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through
the devil’s envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party
experience it” (Wis 2:23-24).

All of this changes, however, when we come to the New Testament. Whereas St
Paul could look back on his pre-Christian existence as one of sinlessness
before the Law (Phil 3:6), as a Christian he had come to see that God had
“consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom
11:32). How did Paul get from there to here? He met his Savior on the road to
Damascus!

But the myth of a lost paradise haunts our dreams. As J. R. R. Tolkien wrote
to his son Christopher:

Myth is gathered into the absolute truth that is the final future. Jesus is
risen. The dream of paradise has been realized in the Mystery of Holy
Eucharist. At the conclusion of the Divine Liturgy, the faithful sing:

Having read your series, it seems like St. Isaac believes in pre-destination.
I wonder how he would have reacted to the conversation between Ivan and
Alyosha in Brothers K?

Justification by faith proclaims the utter freeness of the grace of God,
gratuitously bestowed on all through the preaching of the good news of Jesus
Christ. Apokatastasis is but the gospel of Christ’s absolute and unconditional
love sung in an eschatological key.

Capon described the writing of this book a “watershed experience” and
considered it his most important book. It’s difficult to describe. The first
part is a parable of two adulterous lovers, Paul and Laura, with Caponic
commentary. Many will find the parable scandalous, because the two lovers do
not repent of their sin. Capon, of course, is not endorsing sin (despite
appearances, he is not an antinomian); but he wants us to see that
unconditional love (represented by Laura) transcends moralism. The second part
is an imaginary coffee house Q&A between Capon and his parish­ioners. The
third part is another parable—this time a parable about the gangster-style
execution of a New Jersey mobster. Is it possible for God to forgive murder,
redeem murder? Yes, Capon boldly asserts. Evil is eternally enveloped, judged,
and redeemed within the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

But in any case, if we take Saul of Tarsus as an example, when Christ appeared
to him, was he coerced into salvation by the will of God? I don’t think so. Or
did he himself choose or will his response to Christ? I don’t think so. I just
don’t see ‘will’ being the primary faculty involved. Rather, he ‘saw’ and then
*naturally* repented and believed. His ‘nous’ was enlightened which then
activated his natural will. If there is anything to this, then what great hope
we might derive from the promise, ‘And every eye I shall see him’ … after
which ‘and every knee shall bow’ would make perfect sense.

For a philosophical argument based on a libertarian understanding of free
will, see “[What Are the
Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-salvation-what-are-
the-odds/)”

Unlike the Latin Fathers, many of the Eastern Fathers believed that when
Christ descended to hades, he saved all of its inhabitants. This universality
of the Lord’s paschal work is also reflected in the Orthodox Church’s hymnody.
This is one reason why the greater hope simply will not go away in Orthodoxy.

Brad, I presume that “holy monk of Mt. Athos” who is quoted is St. Silouan?
Thanks. I needed to read that after reading Fr. John’s posts on this subject.
It is that precise agony of prayer in my own experience, a deep grief that any
should miss Christ and be lost, that I believe prompted the Lord in His mercy
to open my eyes to the Orthodox Church. Without at least a hope that all might
be saved–without a genuinely Orthodox Paschal vision–I don’t see how I would
be able to go on getting up again after I fall down in my walk with Christ. I
live in dread that Fr. John’s interpretation of the Tradition of the Church
might be correct. This fallen world is already more a hell to me than I can
handle–watching cultures coarsen, crash and burn, knowing how people suffer
and being mostly powerless to help any of them. St. Silouan’s vision is the
prayer that keeps me going.

But no one denies free will. Everything here is an affirmation of it. It is
the “voluntarist” view of freedom, paradoxically, that would make the will
incapable of freedom. Do you, as a Christian, believe you are free just
because you make choices, or that you are ever freer the better the choices
you make are? Because they correspond to the truth that is God, I mean?
Forgive me, but you simply need to think the matter through with greater
attention to the logic of freedom and the logic of what metaphysical and modal
attributes are entailed in the word “God.” No Church Father ever had a keener
and fuller and more sophisticated understanding of free will than did Gregory
of Nyssa. None was a more adamant and unhesitating universalist. The two
things are not in tension in his thought; they are necessarily logically
implied in one another.

The publication of _That All Shall Be Saved_ in 2019 was a major event. It
pushed the question of universal salvation to the theological front-burner.
The majority of online reviews, though, suggest that the brethren would rather
dismiss the universalist thesis as outright heresy rather than engage it
constructively and substantively. Fortunately all is not lost.

It is often not noticed that a significant doctrinal correction has occurred
in Christian theology. For 1500 years hell has been thought as everlasting
retributive punishment. This is no longer the case. Over the past 75 years
Western philosophers and theologians have rejected the punitive model of hell
and have proposed what is a free-will model. Quite independently, Orthodox
theologians have advanced the “river of fire” model. Universal salvation is
but the logical conclusion of the free-will and river of fire models. God is
love, and he will not be satisfied until all have been converted to him in
love.

I thought the same thing about the entirety of “A Voice from the Emerald
World.” Surely you were a fan?

Talbott was asked to write a new essay for the online Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. This article provides a helpful review of recent philosophical
discussion of hell. Talbott does not hide his universalist sympathies. For a
different perspective, see [the article by Jonathan
Kvanvig](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/heaven-hell/) that
Talbott’s piece replaced.

_I will update this list as I continue to read on this subject._

You may be right, Marc. I am agnostic when it comes to the demonic powers, as
it seems to me that all of our speculation about them is precisely
that–speculation. We do know anything about their nature and existence. All we
know is their enmity toward God and toward us. Satan is our enemy. Hence I am
content to remain agnostic. Perhaps they are beyond repentance and thus beyond
salvation.

I should have some coffee. Ss Macrina, Gregory Nyssen, Gregory Nazianzen, and
Isaac Syrus pray for us all. St George MacDonald of Aberdeenshire too.

Gavrilyuk offers a helpful introduction to Bulgakov’s eschatology. He is
ultimately critical of Bulgakov’s universalist convictions: he thinks that the
great theologian slides into a metaphysical necessitarianism, just as Origen
did. I disagree. Bulgakov is too concerned to preserve the synergistic freedom
of the creature to allow any kind of necessity to govern his eschatological
convictions.

If you are looking for a philosophically sophisticated defense of the
universalist hope, this is the book for you. Kronen and Reitan are both
trained philosophers. They are well acquainted with the philosophical
literature on universalism, as well as with the scholastic tradition. They
critically analyze the classical and modern doctrines of hell, present the
arguments they deem most convincing in support of universal salvation, and
respond to various objections. Anyone who wants to argue against universalism
first needs to read _God’s Final Victory_ and address its arguments.

I review the argument of Kronen and Reitan that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if the lost suffer everlastingly.

Hayes synthesizes Catholic reflection on the last things over the past 50-60
years. This book is helpfully read alongside Ratzinger’s _Eschatology_.

Yakoov, St Isaac the Syrian certainly thought so. See my series on [Isaac and
universalism](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/st-isaac-the-syrian-
preaching-the-astonishing-love-of-god/).

and cons in the various views from universalism to acknowledging Hell’s

Eric C.: I think that even among those who believe in libertarian free will
(no determinism), many, perhaps most, still believe that God can foreknow what
we will freely do (even if God can’t cause us to do what we do, if we’re to be
free). If you think universalism is revealed in inspired scripture, you
needn’t buy into determinism, but just divine foreknowledge.  
(Actually for me, that doesn’t help, because I’m among the minority who think
God cannot even foreknow, at least with absolute certainty, what we will
freely do. But I still count myself a universalist. I think that so long as
you accept that it’s overwhelmingly probable that all will be saved, you
should count. I also have another scheme by which the salvation of all might
be absolutely certain, but won’t go into that here.)

Come to think of it, even the priests I know who reject universalism have
still been very welcoming. For instance, my priest back home (I’m from the
Northwest U.S.) was a fan of Fr. John, but he never saw my inclination towards
universalism as something that should exclude me.

And do you believe he really believed he was headed for eternal perdition? It
is a wonderful statement of humility and hope, not a prophecy.

Universal salvation is the only “tolerable” answer to evil and suffering in
the world.

I am not good at web-exchanges, since I don’t like being on the computer, and
these days I don’t have much energy. So you may have to wait for my next book
for my answer. But two quick answers:

A collection of essays discussing the universalist hope articulated by various
theologians in the history of the Church, from Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa
to Sergius Bulgakov, and Karl Barth. Tom Talbott’s piece on George MacDonald
is of particular interest. A helpful and instructive volume.

Resistance was futile. I’ve just been compelled (in Borg-like fashion) to
purchase the Devil and Pierre. 3 pages in … Screwtape on crack?

“The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom is one
in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance, wills
the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to achieve
that end without hindrance. ”

This book shares Capon’s reflections on the parables of Jesus. Each parable,
Capon believes, witnesses to the kingdom now present in Christ, a kingdom that
Jesus gifts to his hearers. Even the parables of judgment witness to the
unconditional love of Christ and his Father. Yes, his exegesis is sometimes
off-the-wall and unconvincing, yet that is what can be so helpful to us. We
need to have our expectations turned upside-down and inside-out.

Thus Silouan’s famous rebuke of the hermit who gleefully rejoiced in the
eternal punishment of atheists: “Love could not bear that. We must pray for
all.” Similarly, when asked by Olivier Clement what would happen if a person
does not agree to open his or her heart and accept the love of God, Sophrony
replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell, Christ will
remain there with him.”

Second, freedom as defined in a purely voluntarist, spontaneous, atelic
movement of the will–pure libertarian freedom–might be denied by the doctrine
of apokatastasis. But that is a logically incoherent model of freedom in any
event. The classical Platonic-Aristotelian-Christian understanding of freedom
is one in which the rational will of necessity, when set free from ignorance,
wills the good end of its own nature; and perfect freedom is the power to
achieve that end without hindrance. Thus God is perfectly free precisely
because he cannot work evil, which is to say nothing can prevent him from
realizing his nature as the infinite Good. Similarly, for Gregory of Nyssa or
Gregory of Nazianzus, perfect freedom is liberation from the fetters of
ignorance that constrain the rational will from seeing the Good as what it is.
For Augustine, the highest freedom is the perfection of human nature in a
condition of “non posse peccare.” For Maximus, the natural will is free
because it tends inexorably towards God, and the gnomic will is free precisely
to the degree that it comes into harmony with the natural will. And so on.
Since, after all, all employments of the will are teleological–necessarily
intentionally directed towards an end, either clearly or obscurely known by
the intellect–and since the Good is the final cause of all movements of the
will, no choice of evil can be free in a meaningful sense. For evil is not an
end, and so can be chosen under the delusion that it is in some sense a good
in respect of the soul (even if, in moral terms, one is aware that one is
choosing what is conventionally regarded as “evil”); and no choice made in
ignorance can be a free choice.

Patristic Universalism: An Alternative to the Traditional View of Divine
Judgment by David Burnfield

With reference to C. S. Lewis’s _The Great Divorce_ , I reflect on the
possibility of heavenly happiness when one knows that one or more loved ones
are suffering everlasting torment.

David, I had heard from Addison that you have been quite ill. May the Lord
grant you a speedy recovery–and if not a _speedy_ recovery, then at least a
_full_ recovery.

For my own part, it does not bother me that Fr. John holds the opinions he
does, but rather that he wishes to exalt his personal theologumena to doctrine
to which all Orthodox Christians ought to adhere. He wishes for Orthodoxy to
preach doctrine that, in all honesty, would likely have kept me from ever
converting to the faith.

Ramelli explores Origen’s and St Gregory Nyssen’s integration of philosophy
and biblical exegesis in their reflections on apokatastasis. If you can’t
afford her mono­graph (who can?), then by all means take a look at this essay.
Ramelli believes that Origen (and by implication Gregory) has been
misunderstood and misrepresented by the ecclesiastical tradition. He certainly
was no Origenist.

This, in a nutshell, is the reason it is hard for me NOT to be a universalist.
How could true freedom result in anything but one’s salvation? The alternative
would be a god who allows certain beings to remain damned by their ignorance.

David’s article in First Things on Augustine’s misread of Rom. 9-11 was
especially helpful.

A fine article that Jersak wrote for Eclectic Orthodoxy. He maintains that the
universalist hope remains a legitimate option within the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Do not let others tell you otherwise.

The truth shall set you free! It is our ignorance that leaves us to make
inferior choices.

Standing under the judgment of the Cross (and bound by Catholic dogma), we may
not assert apokatastasis, says Balthasar; but we may—and indeed must—pray for
the salvation of all. Universal restoration in Christ is a possibility for
which we may hope, but can never be a certainty we may proclaim.

Morwenna Ludlow, _[Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory
of Nyssa and Karl
Rahner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199566968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN99566968&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20)_

Both “never” and “forever” are awfully big words. Could a finite and imperfect
being be envisioned as having the constancy to refuse through an infinity of
time? Scripture seems to describe the sinful man as wavering. I shortcircuits
my thinking to try to posit such an infinite and firmly consistent refusal on
the part of a finite, flawed, and inconstant being such as we all are.

I’m not sure I’d word it that way, but what I would say is that some ignorance
is inevitable. Infinite knowledge is not a possibility for a finite being. I
like to say that my head just isn’t big enough to stuff the whole universe and
its God inside. There will always be more questions unanswered than those to
which we have answers, and a discussion of this sort simply cannot have a
terminus ad quem, for inevitably there will be more to know. We can only
guess, with greater or lesser probability. But I can only suspect that God,
given an infinity of time in which to show infinite mercy will ultimately
teach us enough to incline us to acceptance of the Cross and Resurrection, of
the ultimate gift of Christ.

This is a classic in Roman Catholic literature on the subject. Here we see the
decisive break in post-Vatican II Catholicism from retributivist models of
both purgatory and hell.

The 5th Ecumenical Council rejected universalism. Dare we think we know better
than the 5th Ecumenical Council? No.

This six-article series on St Isaac the Syrian might be considered as a
systematic mini-presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, concluding in the
eschatological reconciliation of sinful humanity and fallen angels with their
eternal Creator. Please read the series in order. But if are too impatient to
read the entire series, I give you permission to skip to the end: “[The
Triumph of the Kingdom Over
Gehenna](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/23/the-triumph-of-the-kingdom-

Satan](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/08/30/the-demonic-void-and-the-
apokatastasis-of-satan/).”

Wonderful article and comments. Mr Hart, I’ve ordered your book. One thing I’d
like to add: the idea of ignorance vs knowledge, the force of the final [or
not] ‘No’: this is not always or only ignorance, but pathology. No one
violates free will by healing; the Gospel accounts of, eg, the demoniacs or
paralytics stand for this principle. If a man be healed of the
mental/spiritual pathology that lead him to ‘no’, surely he will say Yes. This
avoids the trap of loss of epistemic distance, I think, because you can posit
resistance to everything except the final force majeure.

May I turn the question back upon yourself? If God were to say to one of two
things to you, either “My dear Yaakov, I love you ultimately and absolutely
and I will always find a way to turn your heart to me, no matter what” or
“Yaakov, you are right, only you will perish and there’s nothing I can do to
save you,” which word would you find most encouraging, most transformative?

Origen did NOT invent the doctrine of universal salvation. Going back to the
second century there existed a position that may be described as “intercessory
universalism.”

My struggle in understanding the inescapable conclusion of universalism still
rests in not understanding why a human person is not capable of continually
refusing to accept God’s salvific offer of Himself in Christ. So I have a
couple questions which might help further clarify the argument.

I am pretty sure that if this was a dream I would be married to Kate Upton.

A very interesting discussion…On reading the posts, some quite technical and
others quite poetic and evocative, I could not help but think of the need for
this type of conversation to be more broad in that such a topic has also been
addressed in other religious traditions. I think, for instance, of the
Buddhist tradition, ( Mahayana), of the Bodhisattvas who refuse entering total
enlightenment until all beings are also saved, enlightened.  
On ignorance and enlightenment, Dogen Zenji is quite adamant that
enlightenment occurs in the midst of ignorance. He upholds a paradoxical way,
one that I find challenging to our usual black/white, binary logic.  
At any rate, I find the discussion to have been, for me, quite fruitful and
encouraging. I hope the participants, all of them, find the goal they are
earnestly striving for.

Hi, everyone. I’m stepping in here and asking everyone to return to the theme
of the page–the hope of universal salvation. Thank you.

P.S. What are the chances that you will be coming to Princeton in the next two
years?

Forgive my incessant probing, but I have to ask you about something (related
to created agency) which I’ve had on my mind since reading your book ‘The
Beauty of the Infinite’.

(and then you could go into Revelation with the gates in the Holy City as
being open and not gated… but it could be argued that that was a
representation of the current realities of those that belong to the Kingdom
and the holy city is a representation of the Christian faith at the time when
John the Revelator wrote the book on the island.)

Daniel, have you considered the possibility that you are confusing creaturely
causality and divine causality? As I have expressed in a couple of my past
postings, popular understandings of synergism appear to put God in the same
metaphysical level (just as so many analytic philosophers do today). Hence
they present human freedom and divine action as mutually competitive. But this
simply cannot be the right way to think about the relationship between the
Transcendence and human beings. Take a look at these past articles of mine:

Or, who are you? “Brian” isn’t that uncommon a name. Tell me, are you Brian
Blessed (my favorite living Brian)?

A brilliant exposition of the critical assertion in Sergius Bulgakov’s
universalist eschatology that at the Second Coming all will love Christ.

On reflection, I think the first. However, I think that the first statement is
kind of a given, even in St. Anthony’s statement. It’s not that God will not
find a way to turn our heart to him, but that we don’t accept his invitation.

I take it the first just means the will is empowered by God (given God’s
purposes for its final end, mind you) to say ‘no’ (as well as ‘yes’) to
embracing God as its final end. I’m not sure what you mean by the second
claim. If you mean only that the will can never finally rest in anything other
than God, that God is the only thing it can finally convert to, then yes. But
if you mean that under the right circumstances (say, final judgment) our God-
given power to say ‘no’ can be converted irrespective of its exercise as a
power to interrupt itself, then I’m inclined to disagree…

William Desmond draws a distinction between the _conatus essendi_ (the
striving, struggle for living) and the _passio essendi_ (the pure giftedness
of our being which is the prior foundation upon which the latter derives.)
Modernity is largely blind to the _passio essendi_ and it would not see it as
freedom. Instead, it identifies freedom with something that is derivative,
secondary, and not really a metaphysically coherent concept of liberty. True
freedom as the perfected flourishing of one’s being is an eschatological
fruition that can be anticipated insofar as one’s actions bring one closer to
the unique gift of one’s being/vocation granted by the creator God.

Andreano explores what Origen really taught about the eternal destiny of
Satan. Some fascinating material here. After you’ve read this, read Bulgakov’s
essay “On the Question of the Apocatastasis of the Fallen Spirits.” Makes for
an interesting comparison.

In his great work _The City of God_ , St Augustine identifies seven
universalist and semi-universalist positions that were prevalent in his day
(early 400s). Though he disagreed with all of them, he only judged one of them
as heretical—specifically, the assertion that Satan and the demons will be
saved. Note: he did not consider the claim that all humanity will be saved as
heretical.

The radical unconditionality of divine grace is the evangelical heart of the
theological writings of Robert Farrar Capon. So why isn’t he proponent of
universal salvation?

Fr Aidan call tell you how long I’ve complained about the idea that postmortem
salvation proceeds via an overwhelming revelation of truth that effectively
determines our ‘yes’ for God. ;o

Some other universalist voices: St. Silouan the Athonite and (according to Fr.
Cyril Hovorun and Balthasar) probably Maximus the Confessor.

Too long a question. I think I have been pretty clear in saying that the
conversion in question is necessarily a conversion of the will through its own
free (and progressively freer) act. Even the will’s power to say no, however,
is animated by its primordial hunger for the Good and, as Gregory and others
argue, to that it cannot say no, except by ceasing to exist. That is the act
of all its acts. So, in time, over the ages perhaps, it continues to seek its
rest in God, freely but, for that reason, inevitably.

It is generally assumed by Orthodox believers that the doctrine of everlasting
damnation enjoys the status of irreformable or infallible dogma. It is
therefore necessary to examine the nature of dogma and what it means, at least
for the Orthodox, to characterize a dogmatic statement as irreformable. As we
see in this article, matters are more complex than popularly taught,
especially when it comes to eschatological questions.

Dear friend,  
I have been enjoying greatly David Bentley Hart’s thinking on this matter. He
is wrestling with this in translating the New Testament, and is coming to some
fascinating conclusions. We spoke of the two words for (eternal) punishment,
with one kolasis-punishment for a time, for correction; and timoria-punishment
of vengeance. Next he noted that there are forty or so passages in the NT
about universal Salvation, and only one meaning eternal punishment. The
strongest adversary is St. Augustine, not working from Greek but Latin, and
his emendations of the language in Romans 5:18 (which in Greek has neither
subject, nor verb, nor object), and I Corinthians 15:22. And, Augustine is
particularly strident in his polemic against Julian, who riled him as no other
did in Augustine’s late age. (Ep. 101, 4). See Augustine’s Contra Jul. 4, and
24.

“The moral conscience may accept hell, understood in the sense of a state of
purification of the soul – lasting, perhaps, but not perpetual. But here is
what matters: hell can be vanquished, and it is already vanquished. This is
the central affirmation of our Faith. To believe in Christ is to believe in
His victory over hell. He is the vanquisher of death and of hell. He is our
Deliverer. He alone can liberate us from hell, even now or in the next life.
It should be added that the Orthodox Church disregards the Latin distinction
of hell and purgatory. She prays for all the dead and does not accept that
there are any who are already damned forever. The existence beyond the grave
is nothing but the continuation of the deceased’s destiny, with its
progressive purifying and liberating action – a healing, a maturation and a
creative expectation.”

Faced with the lights of the Kingdom of heaven in the night (in itself
hopeless) of hell, we are therefore empowered by faith to throw ourselves
naked into the love of God. As worthy descendants of Abraham—“In hope he
believed against hope” (Rom 4:18)—we hope that the bottomless depths of God’s
fatherhood, of Christ’s Passion, and of the resources of the Holy Spirit will
allow us to escape from the fiery prison that is hell. We can say nothing of
how this might be; but we must trust absolutely in the reserves of love,
grace, and glory, whose only measure is God’s love for the Son in the Holy
Spirit, a love in which we are forever included. Moreover, since God has
revealed to us in his Son that we are saved and saveable by pure grace, and
never by our works (Rom 1–4), how could it be otherwise when the eschatology
of every creature is decided, at the crowning moment when the mystery of
grace, in which we have been established for all time by God himself, will be
fulfilled? In this light, hell becomes, with regard to a boundless faith, the
location of choice for God’s victory over the most incomprehensible
rejection—victory that could be called humanly unexpected and that is for the
prayer of the spiritual and for the thought of the theologian “able to be
hoped for.”

For the past century the two principal models of eternal damnation have been
the retributivist and free will. Manis now introduces a third which he
believes expresses the best of both approaches—the divine presence model: God
eternally and only intends the salvation of every human being, but human
beings remain free to definitively reject his gracious gift. “The eternal
suffering of hell,” Manis contends, “is not the result of any divine act that
aims to inflict it, but rather the way that a sinful creature necessarily
experiences the unmitigated presence of a holy God.” Also see my [four-part
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/book-review-sinners-in-the-
presence-of-a-loving-god/) of the book.

Before a person can seriously entertain the universalist hope, he must become
per­suaded that the the Father of Jesus Christ loves sinners absolutely,
uncondi­tion­ally, nontransactionally. I can think of no better theologian to
assist us in grasping this truth than Robert Capon—not because Capon is a
theologian of the first-rank (he doesn’t even belong to the second-rank), but
because he has an uncanny ability to think outside the conditionalist box.
Such an ability is necessary when interpreting the New Testament as
eschatological discourse. Capon also has a whimsical writing style that often
makes me chuckle (and sometimes cringe).

First read Brad Jersak’s article “[Apocatastatic
Hymnody](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/let-every-mortal-leap-for-
joy-apocatastatic-hymnody-in-orthodox-worship/)” and then follow up with this
article. In addition to noting the universalist-orientation of Orthodox
hymnody, Howell also discusses the Last Judgment hymns, often cited as
testimony for the everlasting damnation position. His conclusion: when we
read, hear, and sing the hymns of the Orthodox Church, “we realize that the
universalist hope never did disappear” in the life of the Church.

I am far more conscious of the many people who have apostasized of any form of
traditional Christian faith or who despair of God’s help because of the
unnuanced preaching of everlasting damnation coupled with the awareness, in
this age of mass media, of all the evil and suffering perpetrated in the world
(a lot of it these days in the name of superior fidelity to the supreme
“God”!) than I do any Christians who do not take the working out of their
salvation seriously because of a cavalier universalist hope in the scope of
Christ’s defeat of the powers of hell. I am blessedly reminded by St.
Silouan’s words here of Christ’s parable of the Lost Sheep, how for the sake
of the one lost, the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 in the fold to go seeking the
one that remains lost. . . . This alone gives hope to my breaking heart. It is
only when I dare to hope that the Lord might really be this relentless and
victorious in His love, that I feel sin begin to loosen its grip on me.

OK with all that said…. Which authors or theologians in your reading have you
come across that would agree or created this thought? Thank you so much for
your help!

I know that Maximus often speaks of the gnomic will as simply the sinful and
deviating will. Something tells me–more a phenomenology of consciousness than
a moral metaphysics–that it might be better to think of it as the “third
moment” of the conscious act, so to speak, the first two being the primordial
intention of the natural will and the power of intellect (both being
rational). Then the gnomic will is that supremely rational moment of (ideally)
assent or love or creative liberty that completes the “trinitarian” movement
of the mind and makes it genuinely rationally free.

What a delight to see David Bentley Hart’s thoughts. My own notes were that
two of the texts commonly viewed as signalling eternal punishment were based
on mis-readings by St. Augustine: namely the Romans 5:18, and the I
Corinthians 15:22, as suggested to me by David. I added the specific
references from St. Augustine’s Epistles, and his Contra Jul., again having
pointed in those directions by David. I hope I have the transliterated Greek
accurate.

But also, and perhaps a bigger misunderstanding for me, is, isn’t universalism
deterministic, does it not require one to be mongerstic, where does free
agency come in, if we can boldly say that all WILL be saved, rather than
reserving judgment and saying all MAY be saved, for if even only one is
allowed his freedom and chooses to shrink away from the humanity and divinity
he was created for, in essence, in hell, moving in the opposite direction of
theosis. Would this not then render universalism false? This of course
presupposing synergism, whereas if we say all WILL be, then are we not
mongerist? Is it not simple the moral form of determinism?

Brad’s book is perhaps the best book on hell that I have read

Human beings are not created in a neutral state _vis-à-vis_ their Creator.
They are created with a natural desire for union with him.

Are you sure that you’re not my secret Doppelgaenger, and that soon I’m going
to wake up and realize I’m not I at all but someone you dreamed (in a
Guinness-induced delirium)? I’m pleased you had the wisdom to avoid the
academic world once you got doctored, but I would like to know what you do,
where you are, and whether you write anywhere. And, if not, there’s a journal
I’m associated with…

That Nazianzus gathers and affirms the philocalia of Origen seems a part of
the same project. It would have saved us some pain if they had formally
declared Origen a father at their council. However, it is not without import
that Benedict XVI numbered Origen as one of the fathers in his book on the
Fathers.

I don’t follow. Is belonging to the Church the same thing as being rendered
magically sinless? And who denies that one can suffer spiritual harm? I am
sorry, but your question does not seem to have any relation to the claim being
made ( which, incidentally, is exactly the same claim as Maximus the Confessor
makes about freedom).

I can’t believe that two heroes of mine (Fr Aidan) and Dr Hart) are denying
it. Christ have mercy… on us all.

I think I see where you’re coming from Shane. For my part, this is where I
imagine (with Paul, I think, in 1 Cor. 15) that omnipotent love graciously
initiates the parousia in all its efficacy, and everlasting blessedness is not
something we can either achieve by our goodness or sabotage by our delusions …
Rather, when the True Light shines, the darkness of delusion will be dispelled
and healing love will do its work on our hearts … the synergism of this, I
hope, will be the genuine, willing response of someone being brought back from
the dead (DBH’s ‘third moment’). In other words, we’re counting on a love
greater in its illuminating power than the blindness of whatever veils of
unbelief and defiance we’ve pulled over our own eyes.

And, had our our Lord spoken of everlasting punishment, that would be an
interesting argument. But he did not speak English, and in fact did not speak
Greek; and the Greek text of Matthew 25:46 (which is the only one you can have
in mind) has been read by a great many Greek-speaking and Syriac-speaking
fathers, from the earliest days, as saying nothing of the sort.

Bulgakov’s famous essay in which he argues for the final redemption of the
fallen angels. His argument is similar to that the argument he presents for
the universal salvation of humanity in _Bride of the Lamb_ , yet he also
recognizes that it will be accomplished differently because of the differences
between angelic spirits and embodied human beings made in the _Imago Dei_. The
salvation story of Satan can only begin when he has been cast out of the world
into the void.

_That All Shall Be Saved_ is profitably read alongside the metaphysical essays
contained in [_The Hidden and the
Manifest_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802865968/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tagìlectorthod-20&camp89&creativeÂ25&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN02865968&linkIdâa367c7766fadca06068c9bb6f10ccf),
especially “Impassibility as Transcendence.”

“On the one hand, Maximus foresees the restoration of the natural will and
speaks of the purifying fire of the Second Coming, something that implies an
end to the puri­fication process, but, on the other hand, he emphasizes the
final rest. Perhaps the answer can be found in a comment from the Q.Thal. 22
(Laga–Steel 1980: 139. 66–141. 80) where Maximus draws a distinction between
the present age, the ‘age of the flesh’, which is characterized by doing, and
the age of the Spirit that will be charac­terized by ‘undergoing’. This
suggests that the final rest will not be a static rest, but that some kind of
activity is conceivable. In addition, it is not specified if the activity of
that age is limited to the righteous only: the analogy to the age of doing
suggests the opposite. Is it possible, then, that with the mysterious phrase
‘ever-moving rest’ ( _ἀεικίνητος στάσις_ ), the Confessor envisioned a rest
similar to the unification of the soul with God, as described by Gregory of
Nyssa, where the soul moves infinitely towards God without ever being able to
reach the end of infinity, but experiencing and participating increasingly in
the divine energies? The ‘undergoing’ of the sinful souls might then be
translated into the contrition and repentance they never had in life, which
could perhaps even then bring them closer to God, while the righteous advance
in their blissful participation of the divine. Something like that would be
consistent with the possibility of a final restoration of all and with
Maximus’ views on the rest. This active rest would have to be understood as an
unchangeable condition, in spite of the movement or undergoing of the souls,
something that would satisfy its position at the end of the Maximian
cosmological triad as the conclusion. It would also mean that it is not
necessary to envision an ontological difference between the righteous and the
wicked, as there is not one now.”

From what I have read, I personally would not describe either [St
Silouan](http://www.bogoslov.ru/en/text/2314168.html) or Elder Sophrony as
explicit universalists; rather, they appear to leave open the possibility of
universal salvation.

Discussion of the 5th Ecumenical Council is scattered throughout the blog, but
see especially my comments in [this
interview](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/an-interview-with-fr-
aidan-kimel/). Short answer: (1) it is doubtful that the council itself
dogmatized on the matter, and (2) the version of apokatastasis addressed by
the anti-Origenist anathemas (whatever their dogmatic status may be) touches
the universalist hope as presented by, say, St Gregory of Nyssa or St Isaac of
Nineveh.

This book contains three essays by Talbott, followed mainly by critical
evaluations of Talbott’s writings from evangelical biblical scholars,
theologians, philosophers, as well as two essays on the history of
universalism in the Church. The book concludes with a response from Talbott to
his critics. This is an excellent book and well worth adding to one’s library.

Now, if God were to say, “My dear Yaakov, no matter what you do or desire,
even against your strongest wish, I will turn your heart to me” – then I’d say
that statement would be more of a turn off than “only you will perish and
there’s nothing I can do to save you”.

You mentioned the toll houses, a curious bit of semi-gnostic bric-a-brac. Fr
John might be interested to know that many monks who embraced that teaching
did so because they were universalists.

Thank you, David. I first became interested in this view from reading
Archbishop Michael Ramsey’s “F. D. Maurice and the Conflicts of Modern
Theology”, (CUP, 1951) which explored the reasons for Maurice being expelled
from King’s College, London, for “unsound views and teachings about the
doctrine of eternal punishment”. In his Theological Essays, Maurice discussed
the use of “aionios” meaning eternal or everlasting, and outside “time”. Barth
writes at length about this- is there anything he doesn’t write at length?
maybe the Kennedy assassination- and Aidan’s note of von Balthasar’s, “Dare We
Hope All Men Be Saved” I found deeply impressive. T  
he last time I saw Ramsey in 1986, he was reading this and “The Glory of the
Lord”, vol. something.

I suppose we all for that. But, really, no citing if crucial texts in dubious
translations–that must be a rule. If Gregory of Nyssa talks of Judas suffering
“eis ton aiona,” then quote him as doing so, as well as the many instances
where he makes clear how he understands that biblical phrase. “Unto infinity”
forsooth. One of the first things to learn about Gregory is that every version
of “infinite” in Greek–apeiron, aperilepton, eyc–is a privileged name for the
divine nature. _Die Unendlichkeit Gottes bei Gregor von Nyssa_ (E. Mühlenberg)
might have been one of the earliest books I read on Gregory’s metaphysics,
flawed though that book is.

A bit of Ratzinger ( _Eschatology_ , pp. 215ff.) to add to the discussion:

Potentially, every source of delusion would be removed or healed when we ‘see
him face to face’ … the telos would be an experience of pure clarity to a
graciously restored mind and will.

Balthasar did not convert me to the universalist hope. The seeds for that hope
were planted back in the early 80s when Thomas Torrance and Robert Jenson
taught me the unconditionality of the divine love. But Balthasar watered those
seeds. Faith in the absolute love of God slowly began to grow into hope for a
universalist Future. Eventually, though, I realized that I needed to proclaim
a more confident, greater hope than Balthasar allows.

What to do? Can we bring your two phrases together in supposing that it is the
very power to interrupt which must embrace God as its end? God saves ‘that’
power, i.e., our will in its God-given power to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. And it
rests when, as a God-given power to interrupt itself, it gives itself to God.
Maybe that’s your position. Sorry if I’ve misunderstood. But that does look
minimally libertarian to me (not a crude claim to a power to self-determine
free from all context and natural constraints).

Seriously, though, when Brian writes: “I maintain that the original gift of
being involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some
level, but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream,
play, wonder, creativity and loving encounter,” it is rather as if I am
reading someone else laying out my own sensibility. But I think there is a
deep theological insight here that is too easily ignored as something vague,
gauzy, or sentimental, because we are all so prone to thinking in the rather
arid categories of (for want of a better word) analytic correspondence that we
regard the entire tacit dimension of knowledge (which is the foundation of all
knowledge) as somehow either merely inchoate or merely emotional. If one is
not careful, one ends up with the barren dialectic of “rationalism” or
“fideism,” and one ends up like a certain popular Thomist I know of, unable to
think in any other terms than that.

I absolutely agree with all you’ve said. I’d love to admire several comments
in particular, but I’ve hogged enough of the convo. So just one quick comment,
on this:

Nemes critically analyzes two classical objections against the universalist
hope, one from the Augustianian-Reformed tradition and the other from the
Arminian-Wesleyan tradition: (1) The divine goodness does not require that God
save anyone. (2) If human beings are genuinely free, then they must be able to
eternally and irrevocably reject God and thus separate themselves from his
love and mercy.

This may be the first book I would recommend to someone who desires to explore
the biblical basis for the universalist hope. Written for a popular audience,
Jersak invites his readers to bracket their dogmatic systems and listen to the
Scriptures afresh, in all of their irreducible diversity and complexity. “Our
obsessive attempts,” he writes, “to harmonize the Scriptures into artificially
coherent, stackable propositions—as if they required us to contend for their
reliability or authority—actually do violence to their richness.” One finds
within the Bible specific texts that may be reasonably interpreted to support
each of the three major construals of eschatological destiny—infernalist,
annihilationist, and universalist. Perhaps we need to hear all three voices.

LOL. I’m going to need to get a job before getting this book but it does look
interesting and weighty.

If you consult the (very dubious) records of the council, you will find
something called Origenism condemned. But no authentic finding of the council
condemns universalism as such.

To our list of Orthodox universalist authors, I would like to add Fr.
Alexandre Turnicev, who wrote Alexandre Turincev (1966) “Une approche de
l’eschatologie orthodoxe,” Contacts 18, no. 54. The article also appeared in
part in Olivier Clément, ‘Dieu est Vivant: catéchisme pour les familles par
une équipe de Chrétiens Orthodoxes’ (Editions du Cerf, 1979), which was the
original French edition of ‘The Living God: A Catechism for the Christian
Faith’, 2 Vols. Trans. by Olga  
Dunlop (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1988) but that chapter was omitted in
the English  
translation. So Father Michael Gillis and the monks from Holy Transfiguration
Hermitage (Gibsons, BC Canada) helped me translate it into English. You can
see it in the Canadian Journal of Orthodox Christianity here:
<http://www.cjoc.ca/pdf/Vol_9_1_1_Eschatology.pdf>

Dame Julian of Norwich was probably not a universalist, not explicitly so, but
her visions of Christ provide a strong case for the salvation of all. Clearly
the greater hope dwelt deep in her heart. “All shall be well.”

Fear not. Fr John is wrong–absolutely and lamentably wrong. God actually is
better than we, not the contemptible tyrant of the servile religious
imagination. Read Isaac. Read George MacDonald’s Unspoken Sermons, the finest
works of theology in the English language.

Ludlow examines the eschatological convictions of St Gregory Nyssen in detail.
“Whoever considers the divine power,” Gregory writes, “will plainly perceive
that it is able at length to restore by means of the _aionion_ purging and
atoning sufferings, those who have gone even to this extremity of wickedness.”
Hell is purgation that culmi­nates in salvation. Gregory’s views on the
apocatastasis were not condemned by the Church at the 5th Ecumenical Council
and would later profoundly influence the eschatological reflection of Sergius
Bulgakov.

This is a long-ranging article in which I respond to a piece by the Catholic
theologian and Balthasar expert Dr Larry Chapp. Following Balthasar, Chapp
confesses a hopeful, but non-necessary, universalism: God may save all, we
should pray that he will save all, but in the end he may not. What is this
“may not” but an admission that God may turn out not to be as good as we hoped
he would be?

I understand (and accept) Plato’s view that all willing is ultimately desire
for the Good in itself. That is a question about the final cause of the will.
But I’m curious: to be truly free does the will necessarily have some kind of
an ‘arbitrary spontaneity’ as an efficient cause?

Balthasar is well known for his advocacy of a non-necessary universalist hope:
we may and should hope that God will save all, but we must not presume that he
will. Wood finds Balthasar’s position unsatisfactory and commends as an
alternative the bold and confident hope of George MacDonald.

“But what about Judas? the universalist is always asked. Judas is the test
case of the Savior’s love. Will Christ, can Christ, save his fallen apostle?

You are free to go home after work today, you are free to drink whiskey once
home, you are free to be selfish or unselfish, mean or nice, and so on. But
your free choices have nothing whatsoever to do with choosing between hell or
heaven. Your ultimate destiny is a matter of God’s grace, I would think. But
of course your choices can help decide how you go about getting there. That
is, how God is going to reconcile you to himself, how difficult or easy that
process is is going to depend on your free choices, to some at least limited
extent, I think, choices have consequences after all. Simply put, free will is
not in tension with universal salvation, and I don’t see how one can read Paul
any other way and get it to make sense.

Yes, I own it, and I agree–it should be on the list. I’ll add it. Thanks.

Not that I would care if it did. That very imperial “ecumenical ” council is
an embarrassment in Christian history, and I sometimes think it a mercy that
such a hash was made of its promulgation that we literally do not know what
was truly determined there. For my money, if Origen was not a saint and church
father, then no one has any claim to those titles. And the contrary claims
made by a brutish imbecile Emperor are of no consequence.

Hi, Eric. For my own thoughts about the Fifth Ecumenical Council, see “[The
Heresy That Never Was](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/apocatastasis-
the-heresy-that-never-was/).”

Lastly, let me say in case I don’t get another chance, I have really benefited
from your writing and lectures. Particularly, I really enjoyed your article on
baseball. But, more seriously, I’ve been working through Beauty of the
Infinite and being challenged throughout. So thank you, and I pray you’ll be
afforded the health to continue writing.

The eschatology of the Orthodox Church is notably underdetermined, in contrast
to that of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result diverse understandings exist
within her precincts. Turincev’s essay represents an excellent introduction to
the eschatology developed by the “Parisian school” of Orthodoxy in the 20th
century, as expressed in this quotation:

But here I’ll withdraw from the conversation. I will lay out my reasoning in
the book, if my health allows. God bless everyone (and I do mean everyone).

Oh, so kind. Again, health is the issue. I began a collection of 25
“parables,,” the first of which appeared as a Back Page column called The True
Helen. I hope to return to that book when I feel well enough. And the. There
is a good deal more fiction I want to write. That was originally what I
planned to do with my life.

He’s ever so much more than an actor. He’s a natural phenomenon as grand, in
his way, as Niagara Falls or Mt Fuji.

Silouan did Not dogmatically assert apokatastasis. He certainly held to more
than a mere hope. Sophrony too. This is not something they hid. Merely read
them.

It’s not doubtful in the Orthodox Church — it is only very recently that you
could cite any Orthodox writers who have espoused universalism. The only
reason St. Gregory of Nyssa’s teachings on this subject (if in fact he ever
taught such a thing) were not condemned by that council was because it was
argued that the quotes you refer to were origenistic interpolations. There is
a similar argument that the quotes from St. Isaac of Syria you refer to are
not his genuine writings. However, even if we grant, for the sake of argument,
that these quotes are authentically the work of those saints, there is zero
evidence that the Church ever embraced those ideas, and mountains of evidence
that they rejected them. The odd opinion of one saint or another does not
trump an ecumenical council. One need only read the patristic commentaries on
Matthew 25:45 “And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life” to see whether the Church thinks that when our
Lord speaks of everlasting punishment, he really mean everlasting punishment.

Again, I think compatibilism and determinism are both inapposite to the
question of freedom; they concern a libertarian model of free acts that I
believe logically vacuous. But my hostility towards analytic philosophy and
its native categories occasionally verges on the unreasonable. Simply said,
all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will reach that end,
and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption prevents them; but
rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still, willy-nilly, all
natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as bliss or torment,
but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot not convert the
will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will never be all in
all and creation will never be completed. That teleological understanding of
the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be forced into the
categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I honestly wish
Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories for that
reason.

Honestly, what you describe expresses where I’m at (though my questions might
suggest otherwise). As you say, “True freedom as the perfected flourishing of
one’s being is an eschatological fruition that can be anticipated insofar as
one’s actions bring one closer to the unique gift of one’s being/vocation
granted by the creator God.” No objection here. I’m perfectly happy viewing
“freedom” as you describe and for the reasons you give.

Pass me a pint gentlemen! Brian, very helpful. Thank you. I’ll look up William
D as well.

However, saying, “I alone will perish” is not a Universalist statement. Are
there other statements that he made suggesting that he was a Universalist?

In short, the realization of metaphysical freedom is not simply the product of
individual choice. Indeed, the person as a center of volition and knowing is
always already not a pure autonomous center of freedom, but a nurtured product
of heteronomy. We come to awareness, desire, knowledge and love because our
existence is gifted, our development nurtured, our very consciousness as
personal called into being by God and world. Without the world, we would not
even acquire the reflectivity that indirectly shows the soul to itself. This
also implies, I think, that a universal making new is consistent with a proper
notion of the person. It is only those who think salvation along the lines of
an atomized individualism that dissent.

“But the the Church dogmatically denounced all expressions of apokatastasis,”
the critic confidently declares, pointing to the anathemas allegedly
pronounced by the Fifth Ecumenical Council. But matters are not so simple. The
anath­emas in question were (1) never formally approved by the Council, (2)
are directed against the strange and esoteric teachings of the 6th century
Origenists, and (3) do not condemn the construals of apokatastasis advanced by
St Gregory of Nyssa, St Isaac of Nineveh, and contemporary proponents of the
greater hope.

I’m already on thin ice, but heck, why not? If your reply shatters the ice
beneath my feet and I disappear into the watery darkness below, I’ll see you
all on the other side anyway because universalism is true!

My wife and I will be moving there in September for her postdoc. I’ve
contacted the local Orthodox parish here in Doha (and the Archbishop in a
chance encounter; he deflected my inquiry) in order to begin conversion to
Orthodoxy, but it has been of no avail. Anyway, my wife and I will be
travelling throughout the region and coordinating our move back to the States
this summer so I will unfortunately not be able to begin the initiation (that
is, if it resembles the duration of RCIA) until we’re settled in Princeton. In
light of Fr. John discouraging universal salvation, I’m hesitant to explain to
an unsympathetic priest that it is largely St. Isaac’s writings on the
atonement and our ultimate reconciliation with God that has drawn me to the
Church. Can you recommend a parish in Princeton where that will not
automatically exclude me from entering the Church?

A courageous essay by a Polish Catholic theologian. Hryniewicz directly
challenges centuries of the pedagogy of fear. The section “Is God Helpless in
the Face of the Gift of Freedom?” is particularly illuminating. “God himself
is the greatest hope for all His creatures,” Hryniewicz writes. “He penetrates
even the infernal depths of the human heart. He can lead out of the depths of
Gehenna. He does not destroy the freedom of rational beings, but respects
human choice. However, he has his truly divine way of persuading the freedom
of the beings most in revolt. He attracts and transforms them from the inside
through His goodness, beauty and boundless love manifested above all in the
voluntary kenosis of Christ.”

The Apostle Peter teaches that after his death, the Lord descended into hades
and preached the good news to the departed. In her hymnody the Eastern Church
sings that the result of this harrowing was the rescue of all.

I have not read this book yet, but Tom Belt assures us that it is an excellent
primer on the topic of universal salvation. See [Tom’s EO
review](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/grace-saves-all-a-book-
review/).

Bulgakov was perhaps the most creative, daring, profound—and also most
contro­versial—Orthodox theologian of the 20th century. Those of us who are
unacquainted with Russian philosophy, as I am, will probably find this a
difficult book to read; yet it is illuminating in ways that most works of
theology are not. Bulgakov’s mind and heart were alive with the Holy Spirit.
He was a true priest and theologian of the Church.

Thanks again for taking the time to clarify. You have said that what you are
arguing is essentially communicated in the works of Gregory of Nyssa, Isaac,
Maximus, and George MacDonald; so it may be that I should read them first and
then return to comment.

That’s an interesting question. I don’t quite understand why a finite and
imperfect being might be capable of achieving everlasting blessedness but not
capable of enacting an everlasting tragedy. In addition, I don’t see why an
ever increased pursuit by God must result in the eventual conversion of the
pursued as opposed to the possibility of an everlasting evasion by the
pursued. I am inclined to think that it becomes harder, not easier, to turn to
God the more a person rejects God. But, like I said, I might be missing
something in the argument, or I might be questioning with unconscious and
false presuppositions about the nature of human being.

“Rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in a
kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny.”

To the list of “Julian was NOT a universalist” scholars you may add Fr. John
Julian, OJN, whose translation and commentary are published by Paraclete Press
under the title “The Complete Julian of Norwich”. Among other things, he
points out that she frequently used the phrase “all who shall be saved”,
implying that not all will be saved. Certainly she was not an avowed
universalist as were Saints Gregory of Nyssa of Isaac the Syrian. However, I
think she was so in pectore, but given the doctrinal and ecclesiastical
climate of Fourteenth Century England, she could only lead her reader to that
truth inferentially. And I think she does so beautifully.

Guinness it is. My treat. I’m not a fan of beer though. A chilled Pinot Grigio
will do, if David Hart will join.

You know, I’ve tried to talk about all this before and I never feel I quite
communicate what I hope to — or perhaps I am simply not as persuasive as I
would like to be. Here’s another attempt.

This has been one of my favorites since it was first published in 1990. The
influence of C. S. Lewis upon Kreeft is manifest. It was here that I first
encountered the view that purgatory is an anteroom of heaven.

What are the conditions of rational freedom, and does the choice to reject God
definitively fulfill them?

Man was not created perfect. Man was created innocent and according to
Gregory, I think, as moral toddlers. This makes the fall inevitable and
therefore, mercy is ultimately God’s only just response. (riffing off Dr
Andrew Klager, an Orthodox universalist). Perfection is the telos of theosis
rather than the first state.

Section III of _Bride of the Lamb_ is devoted to the topic of eschatology.
This section can be read to great benefit just by itself. Bulgakov’s
universalism is neither sentimental nor trite. He does not envision salvation
apart from repentance and ascetical sacrifice. We should fear hell and its
torment, but we should trust God more. “The torments of hell are a longing for
God caused by the love of God,” he states. It is blasphemy to think that evil
will triumph over the the risen Lord. Bulgakov emphatically rejects any
violation of the human person. No one can or should be coerced into the
kingdom. The divine judgment is nothing less than the full revelation of the
Christ, in whose image every human being is made: “Every human being sees
himself in Christ and measures the extent of his difference from this proto-
image. A human being cannot fail to love the Christ who is revealed in him,
and he cannot fail to love himself revealed in Christ.” (See Roberto de la
Noval’s article on Bulgakov, listed below.)

DBH: Sophrony replied: “You may be certain that as long as someone is in hell,
Christ will remain there with him.”

Which, incidentally, does not break from the “synergist” view. It is merely to
say that the cooperation of the created will with God’s is still a
cooperation–if needs be by terrible purgation–in restoring a human soul to its
natural state. I think of Gregory of Nyssa deals with this quite delightfully
and cogently in De anima et resurrectione.

The example of the Bodhisattva is always in the back of my mind. Shantideva’s
Bodhicaryavatara should be required reading for all Christian theologians.
Technically, in the Mahayana–of any inflection (my favorite being Yogacara or
Citta matra, but that’s neither here nor there), the Bodhisattva does not
refuse enlightenment. He is, in fact, fully awakened. But, out of the
superabundance of his metta (compassionate love) and karuna (mercy), he vows
not to “pass over” into Nibbana until all other sentient beings are ushered
in. And this very act is the supreme enlightenment, because in being set free
from tanha absolutely by his compassion he learns that “Samsara and Nibbana
are one”–for, in the eyes of charity, paradise is the compassion that prompts
the great vow.

As for Dogen, the issue of enlightenment (or, technically, awakening) is a
somewhat different issue. But, of course, you are right that knowledge of
anything is not merely a discursive mastery of its attributes, but an
encounter, an intellectual intuition, in which there must be a surfeit of
mystery, or in which the intellect falls silent in being subsumed into…well,
ideally love. That is the yield of apophatic discipline in Maximus, after all.

“St. Paul would be wretched before the throne of God, if he thought there was
one man beyond the pale of His mercy, and that as much for God’s glory as for
the man’s sake. And what shall we say of the man Christ Jesus? Who, that loves
his brother, would not, upheld by the love of Christ, and with a dim hope that
in the far-off time there might be some help for him, arise from the company
of the blessed, and walk down into the dismal regions of despair, to sit with
the last, the only unredeemed, the Judas of his race, and be himself more
blessed in the pains of hell, than in the glories of heaven?

Andrew Louth is a patristic scholar and one of the foremost Orthodox
theologians in the world. Louth grounds Orthodox reflection on the Last Things
in the Divine Liturgy. Louth notes that “in Orthodox theology a hope of
universal salvation, based on a conviction of the boundlessness of God’s love,
has never gone away.”

Focusing on St Paul, Talbott invites us to read the Scriptures afresh,
temporarily bracketing our infernalist suppositions. We might be surprised by
what we find.

In replying above to my inquiry about human agency (framed in terms of the
concerns at play between determinists and indeterminists/libertarians), you
replied:

I think the most important phrase of those anathemas is from 1. “which follows
from it,” identifying, as DBH has said earlier, the problem is only a
particular version of apokatastasis that ‘follows from’ the broader (and
immediate) problematic worldview — one which Gregory of Nyssa had explicitly
repudiated, thereby not only allowing for his own version, but also
rehabilitating Origen’s? (well in advance of the 5th council).

Good points too. I certainly don’t want to boil theosis down to an exchange of
bits of information. So I’ll work on fine-tuning the distinction I’m aiming at
here. My gut tells me there’s a legit (liceitous? Adjective please?) concern
about created agency here (that it not be overwhelmed unto determinism). But
as I’m reading you, you’re not simply positing in a postmortem context the
kind of, say, compatibilist determination of human choice you reject
presently, supposing that God resorts to perfecting human beings postmortem in
a fundamentally different way than at present.

I think I’m tracking with you … so might we say that the showing and seeing is
what heals (rather than coerces) the gnomic will such that neither God’s self-
revelation nor our natural response (of both nous in seeing and will in
following) can be charged with voluntarism?

        * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce73fb23a9bdd58d820b45b0c9bf660b?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) Fr Aidan Kimel says:

I would see a distinction between the hopeful inclusivism of Ware and
Balthasar and the ultimate redemption of which Gregory (and Macrina) were so
confident. It seems to me that there are two types of hopeful inclusivism that
stop short of Gregory. First, those like Ware and Balthasar who insist on the
possibility (in principle, even if ‘infinitely improbable’) that some might,
in the end, resist divine love because of ‘free will.’ Another version,
somewhat softer, and perhaps in both Origen and Barth, that might say, ‘We
believe is as mystery, but cannot teach it as doctrine,’

Wonderful quotation, Brad. Thanks for sharing it. And thanks for the link to
the Turnicev article.

But let’s not pursue the issue. Be wrong in good conscience, and by that you
shall be saved.

This is my multi-article commentary on David Hart’s _That All Shall Be Saved_.
My hope is that others will find it helpful in grasping David’s key arguments.
Together these articles present what I believe is a compelling argument that
God will restore all sinners to himself in his Kingdom.

Perhaps my fears are inspired by versions of universalism I’ve encountered in
which people imagine God instantaneously kicking the doors of our hearts open
and blasting all falsehood away, essentially leaving us no other option but
God, in which circumstance we ‘make the right choice’. I confess I find it
difficult to believe God would be very interested in our coming to conclude he
is our only option under such conditions. But that doesn’t seem to be
anybody’s position here.

If I was only allowed to recommend one book on universalism, this is probably
the one I would choose. Talbott writes clearly and well, and he is sharp as a
tack. The book is intended for a primarily evangelical-Protestant audience.
Orthodox and Catholics will be put off by some of his ecclesiological
convictions; but it’s easy enough to bracket them and simply focus on his
biblical, theological, and philosophical arguments. Talbott has a keen eye for
nonsense. He addresses the biblical testimony head-on. Of particular
importance are the chapters are those in which Talbott discusses human freedom
and the nature of justice. The chapter on predestination is particularly
illuminating.

I’ll presume to suggest my own work, ‘Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hope, Hell
and the New Jerusalem,’ (Wipf and Stock, 2009), which offers a chapter on
Jesus in the Jeremiah tradition, where he consciously quotes or alludes to
every chapter of Jeremiah where ‘the Valley of Hinnom’ is mentioned (and is
symbolic of the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon – i.e. literal destruction) …
surely this plays into Jesus’ use of gehenna in conjunction with the
forthcoming siege in 70. (in part).

I don’t know if this analogy will help, but I think modern, voluntarist
notions of freedom are akin to the way scientism approaches the existence of
reality. Scientism never really asks the question of why there is something
rather than nothing. It can’t understand that an infinite series of finite
causes still can’t address origins — or even feel the need for such,
apparently. Similarly, voluntarism is fixated on finite, concrete situations
and never sees that the source of freedom is prior and other.

To a large extent, opposition to the greater hope is governed by a failure of
imagina­tion: we cannot _imagine_ how God can save all _if_ human beings are
truly free. The logic of eternal damnation binds our minds. In these homilies
MacDonald liberates our imagination and invites us into a vision of the Father
who loves infinitely and eter­nally. “Nothing is inexorable but love,” he
declares. The Father will never abandon his children.

As long as the subject of Dr Hart’s fiction has come up, I’d like to express
how truly outstanding that collection is.

Dr. Hart, Fr. Kimel, the recent comments here have received a lot of
attention, both positive and negative. Here is some negative attention,
wherein you are referred to as no less than heretics. Unfortunately, it seems
that the author of this blog doesn’t allow comments on his posts.

“When once to a man the human face is the human face divine, and the hand of
his neighbor is the hand of a brother, then will he understand what St. Paul
meant when he said, “I wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren.” But he will no longer understand those who, so far from feeling the
love of their neighbor an essential of their being, expect to be set free from
its law in the world to come. There, at least, for the glory of God, they may
limit its expansive tendencies to the narrow circle of their heaven. On its
battlements of safety, they will regard hell from afar, and say to each other,
“Hark! Listen to their moans. But do not weep, for they are our neighbors no
more.”

Greetings, Stanford. Thanks for the suggestion about Dame Julian. I
intentionally omitted her from my list because I have come across two Julian
scholars who deny her universalism. Most recently, see Denys Turner’s book
[_Julian of Norwich,
Theologian_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030019255X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=030019255X&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20).
I tend to trust Turner’s judgment–hence my reluctance to include Julian in my
list. What do you think?

I am recommending this book for its chapter on St Isaac’s eschatology. More
than a few Orthodox priests have whispered to me: “I am a universalist at
heart, but I can’t tell anyone. St Isaac convinced me.” Why the power of St
Isaac’s writings? Because he _knew_ the power and unconditionality of God’s
love–hence his confidence that God will eventually win over the heart and mind
of every human being and every demon.

I am convinced that a failure of imagination partly underlies the resistance
to the greater hope. If a person dies hating and rejecting God, how can God
possibly deliver him or her from that rejection? The medicinal understanding
of purgatory comes to the rescue. That there is a hell for the impenitent, all
universalists affirm. But it is not an everlasting punishment but the painful
redemptive process by which the risen Christ liberates us from our delusions
and addictions and brings us to clear vision of that Love for which each of us
desires.

That the natural will has only one transcendental end is logically necessary.
That is not even debatable because it is written In the very definition of the
will as intentional. Please understand that this is different from saying that
the finite deliberative will or finite mind always wills the truly good as the
Good. You are confusing issues.

So, rounding back to your question — while one can perhaps find some value in
a kind of renewed virtue ethics (Alasdair MacIntyre) or a sense of developed
habit as carrying forward the realized flourishing of identity, I am skeptical
that such notions will carry us as far as you may want in clarifying how our
actions help bring about destiny. I maintain that the original gift of being
involves a unique, singular telos that we are able to intuit at some level,
but that calling is deeply placed and more apt to be touched in dream, play,
wonder, creativity and loving encounter. It’s hard to talk about and
impossible to comprehend. I take it that all our acts of compassion, of
delight, discovery, and insight are those which bring us closer to who we are
meant to be. Also, doubtless, we all fail to attain this calling. Some fail
miserably. I understand the parable of the sheep and goats to be largely
intrapersonal in nature.

Dale directed me here to see if his recollections of our conversations were
accurate. They are not quite…

The universalist views of Origen and St Gregory Nyssen are well known, but
what about St Maximus the Confessor. Andreapoulos believes that strands of
Maximus’s eschatology intimate an openness to the universalist vision, despite
the damnation passages that can be found in the Maximian corpus. Andreapoulos
points to Maximus’s conviction that every human being will experience an
eschatological healing of his gnomic will. When the Good is fully manifested
in the _parousia_ of Christ, why would anyone reject the Good?

Saint Silouan was famous for saying, “all will be saved, and I alone will
perish”. That is not Universalism, it’s humility.

Dr Parry’s contribution to this volume is one of the single best introductions
to universal salvation. Highly recommended.

Thanks for this list Fr. Aidan. I am firmly into the concept that Met. Ware
has expressed. I hope for the salvation of all mankind. However, I believe
that Satan and the demons have already been judged and condemned to
annihilation in the Lake of Fire which is prepared for them. God has waited to
carry out their execution because he wants to save all humanity if possible.
The Church Fathers who believed that Satan and the demons would be saved have
no basis in Holy Scripture and the acts of Satan and the demons to base their
teaching on. Where there is no repentance, there is not life.

“Grigio” is a euphemism for “blush.” I’m a noir man all the way, if it’s good.

Will read that sermon between chapters of the Devil and Pierre! I like the
subtle threat of hell to those alone who would use it to terrorize — no need
for iron in paradise — the kind of rhetorical reversal we see in Christ’s
parables.

Dale,  
Those two verses are actually universalist verses. Augustine’s curious

One might conceivably see _passio essendi_ as being lacking will, but I think
it is better to see it as a compact, elemental gift from which all other
powers derive. It is not so much a lack of freedom as a richness that includes
a joyous reception of being that grounds reason and will. I take it that the
libertarian objection is that somehow authentic freedom would require,
contradictorily, a lack of metaphysical freedom or some quality of the
indeterminate in order to remain free, but this is just to posit freedom
wrongly to begin with.

Even if there is no such thing as efficacious grace by which God can
unilaterally convert the wicked, philosopher Eric Reitan argues that their
salvation is statistically certain, as long as God continues to offer his
forgiveness after death.

Anyway, let Fr John believe as he believes. I have encountered that sort of
Orthodox or Catholic before. They are often the most vigorous in good works
too (being far nicer, it seems, than the God their theology describes).

Our creation in Christ has made us, by vocation, into beings to whom the
Father is as essential as he is, by paternity, to the Son himself. But we
should not forget the other face of this mystery, whereby we appear, in
Christ, as eternally irreplaceable to the Father as the Son is to him.
Confronted with the suicidal decision to reverse into hatred the love for
which we have all been created and which makes us, in the Father’s eyes,
inseparable from the person of his Son, could God, even out of respect for our
freedom, abandon forever the person who destroys himself in the self-torture
of his aberration? How could he do so, this God who, in Christ wishes to raise
us by pure grace to his likeness, and promises to share with us the life of
his uncreated Son? Such is the choice of the unfathomable depth of his love
for us. Henceforth there is no human rule, no safeguard of morality that can
prohibit God from loving madly the madman who believes that in order to exist
he must refrain from loving him who is love itself! God’s remedy for madness
consists then in bringing into play all the resources of his love to help the
rebel overcome his insane refusal to love. For what kind of God would he be
who, despite being declared all-powerful, was forever incapable of releasing
from his mortal spell a freedom that was received without being requested, and
that could become a snare of pain and hatred to its recipient, for all
eternity?

I confess I do press hard, but only to see how much is discoverable; to test-
drive theories. But I’d be happy with the mere affirmation THAT our actions
contribute (in ways that do not reduce to mere secondary causation). If that’s
affirmed, I can tolerate any amount of mystery.

Totally agree with DBH’s point that our truest freedom is a will at rest in
God as its telos—where God is desired and intended in all things. And of
course I’d agree that wrestling someone to the ground who intends to set
themselves afire is not an intervention in their freedom.

It used to trouble me, as a young aspiring student of Asian religions, that
the typical way in which the work of Christ was preached from pulpits made it
seem not only that our God is morally inferior to the bodhisattva, but that in
fact Christianity was burdened by a thwarted moral imagination, and that the
Mahayana made this obvious. Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald and Isaac of
Ninevah (etc.) prevented me from abandoning the faith as an ungainly alloy of
the ennobling and the barbaric.

Have you come across “All Shall Be Well – Explorations in Universal Salvation
and Christian Theology from Origen to Moltmann” edited by (you-know-who)
Gregory MacDonald?  
Among others it contains Origen (obviously), Schleiermacher, P. T. Forsyth,
Barth, Ellul, T  
Robinson, Balthasar and Moltmann. It is an excellent addition to your already
excellent list.

I guess my question is – if this is true, then why do communicating members of
the Church fall into greivous sin and error? Further, how does this relate to
the pre and post communion prayers which suggest that the effect of God’s
presence can be damaging to those who are unprepared or unrepentant?

I live in Atlanta, have for many years, but my heart is in Western New York
where I grew up.  
Academia avoided me as much as I avoided it, though I was never really keen to
participate.  
Petty, corrupt, earnest about the wrong things, if it’s ever right to be
earnest, and uninterested in what really matters. The only actual career I can
ever remember wanting doesn’t really qualify, I suppose. At some point early
in my youth I wanted to be Capt. Kirk. Not an astronaut, mind you, just
Captain Kirk. (I am a year older than you, btw.) I work as a drudge grading
SAT essays for a national tutoring company. This allows me to eat and to feed
my old Persian cat and the many ferals that I somehow became benefactor to. I
write on Father Kimel’s blog, because he is a terrific priest and I rarely
find a place with an atmosphere congenial to my tastes. I have not attempted
to be published anywhere. When I can find the energy, I work on fiction,
because I think what the world needs is better images to nurture a more true
understanding. I don’t generally get too far with it, but it keeps me
relatively sane.

The relation of divine providence and divine foreknowledge is a difficult,
perhaps intractable, problem, especially for classical theists but also for
modern theists who desire to remain within the mainstream Christian tradition.
This is not an easy piece, but it does shed light and is well worth the read.
At the very least it demonstrates how difficult it is to reconcile eternal
damnation with a God who is benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.

How all that sorts out is ultimately a matter of trust and seeing in a mirror
darkly.

Transformation in the eschaton necessarily exceeds our imaginative capacities.
I have no doubt synergy is involved. No one will be coerced into beatitude.
Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to me that what you may really be after is a
deeper reflection upon the connection between our temporal becoming and
eternal identity. You won’t be able to shoehorn that into a clear and concise
conceptualization. Poets may elucidate a suggestive image. I suspect art, at
any rate, while it must fail as well, will probably fail less than the
language of concepts.

Thanks for the recommendation on Sergius Bulgakov from this blog. He looks
pretty clean as well.

Well, had a look. Not terrifically compelling, however angry. But this Fr John
fellow seems rather unaware of the full Greek and Syriac traditions of reading
the cardinal texts. Someone send him the last chapter of Solomon’s Book of the
Bee. (yes, a Chaldean, but with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Syrian
fathers.) Or Ilaria Ramelli’s latest book, which–for all its flaws–is full of
good citations and references. Or send him to fathers like Gregory of Nyssa or
Isaac of Ninevah, who fully reveal how they understand such terms as “αιωνιος”
or “le-alma” in the course of their expositions. Fr Aidan says Fr John is a
good man. Perhaps. But peremptory certitude allied with broad ignorance is not
piety, but mere fanaticism; and, whatever his personal virtues, this Fr John
fellow simply exhibits neither much scholarly range nor much theological
depth. The thing to recall is that, outside the Seven Councils, the licit
range of theological opinion is far larger than these self-appointed rigorists
know. They do not get to say whether, for instance, Evdokimov, or Olivier
Clement, or Bulgakov (etc.) are less truly Orthodox than they. (Or, to cite
the more moderate, “hopeful” universalists, Alfeyev or Ware.) They believe
their Orthodoxy IS Orthodoxy ( though inevitably they seem to cling to clearly
extra-canonical superstitions like the doctrine of the Tollhouses or bizarre
late 19th century Greek figures like Makrakis, and so on). They also seem to
think the Synodikon and the opinions of certain bishops have an authority that
they clearly do not. Even holy bishops (saints are frequently bad thinkers).
It would be so much easier for them if Orthodoxy had a pope, I suppose, and a
magisterium, and some organ for declaring opinions heresy even on matters not
determined by the ecumenical councils. Alas, it is not so. And, unless another
council is convoked, I fear that merely reciting the opinions (which is all
they are) of certain “holy men” or “holy texts” (rather than others) is not
the same thing as making a good argument. (Oh, but I’ll play along: the
doctrine of the Tollhouses is a crypto-gnostic heresy and those who hold to it
are not TRULY TRULY Orthodox. I make this pronouncement entirely upon the
basis of my own personal predilections and my own unauthorized but very deeply
felt sense of what I have decided to believe is TRUE Orthodoxy, drawn from
sources I have endued with ultimate authority.)

Bringing together Origen, St Gregory Nyssen, and George MacDonald, Ross argues
that universal salvation “entails a concept of judgment just as exacting, just
as rigorous, and every bit as righteous as the sort of purely punitive
punishment on offer in any version of the doctrine of eternal damnation.”

It may be that I simply have not come across universalists of that variety. I
am familiar with patristic universalists, with a variety of mediaeval and
modern figures, I revere George MacDonald especially…but I probably am
entirely unaware of a great deal of popular universalism.

Well, its perfect harmonization with, restoration to, and ultimate
indistinction from the natural will. But, then, that is not elimination, but
rather salvation.

As it happens, I number among my friends and acquaintances some of the
greatest scholars of Orthodox canons and councils and history in the world;
and to a man they would assert that the Orthodox Church–no matter what the
inclinations of its catechists and prelates may have been down the ages–has
never definitively condemned universalism as such, or even addressed it under
any synodical or conciliar conditions of special import. It has condemned some
teachings that are also, as it happens, universalist. But the sort of
universalism found in Gregory and Isaac, which fully acknowledges the reality
of judgment and hell, has never even been addressed.

This article may be the best introduction to Talbott’s approach to universal
salvation. Start here! After you have read this, you should have a good idea
whether you want to read anymore of Talbott’s work.

Analytic philosophy does not own words like “determined,” incidentally. My
problem is specifically with the current analytic categories of determinism,
compatibilism, libertarian freedom, etc., because they all presume an
originally voluntarist understanding of free will, which is simply incoherent.
When I use “determined” in that sentence, I am just speaking of final
causality, primary causality.

Oh, by the way, Capon was not a universalist. He believes that it is possible
for the sinner, like the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son, to
stand outside the festivities of the kingdom. Like C. S. Lewis, Capon
advocates a free-will model of damnation. Might it be possible for the damned
to repent of their rejection of the divine mercy? Perhaps. All moments in time
are eternally held within the spear wound of Christ and thus eternally
available to the damned for their exploration and reassessment.

What that has to do with universalism is that, if it as persons that we are
saved, having achieved personhood through communion, rather than as abstract
essences, then the notion of an eternal hell becomes not only a problem for,
but an absolute barrier to, a coherent concept of salvation. But my dog needs
to be walked, so I can’t explain that now.

That is obscure. Sorry. But, yes, I prefer to think that, healed, it remains,
and that it makes each soul’s reflection of and participation in divine beauty
a unique inflection or modulation of the whole. Which makes each individual
indispensable, of course, to that glory.

I’m not a trained philosopher (which you know by now), and if the Analytic
tradition inherently violates some law of transcendence, then OK. Obviously
that tradition has been employed to deny transcendence. But analytic thinkers
can employ the standard categories to affirm transcendence as well, no? (Denys
Turner perhaps?) But, as far your comments in the quote go, it looks to me
like you employ the categories you want equally to dismiss—i.e., all things
are “determined” to a “final cause,” “rational nature” can interrupt itself,
and “teleology” drives the process. Are not these terms standard analytic-
talk?

In the general eschatological context, how must we consider these wildly
categorical affirmations of St. John Chrysostom concerning the chaining,
humiliation and death of hell – its annihilation? Let us state frankly – the
idea of eternal hell and eternal suffering for some and eternal bliss
(indifferent to suffering) for others, can no longer remain in the living and
renewed Christian conscience as it was formerly presented in our catechisms
and our official theology courses. This archaic conception which claims to be
based on the Gospel texts, understands them in a literal, coarse and material
sense, without penetrating the hidden spiritual meaning of the images and
symbols. This conception is increasingly showing itself to be an intolerable
violation of Christian conscience, thought and faith. We cannot accept that
the sacrifice of Golgotha has revealed itself to be powerless to redeem the
world and conquer hell. Otherwise we should say: creation is a failure, and
Redemption is also a failure. It is high time for all Christians to witness in
common and reveal their mystical experience – intimate in this area – as well
as their spiritual expectations, and perhaps also their revolt and horror
before materialistic, anthropomorphic representations of hell and the Last
Judgment, and of the heavenly Jerusalem. It is high time to be done with all
these monstrosities – doctrinal or not – often blasphemous, from ages past,
which make of our God of Love that which He is not: an ‘external’ God, who is
merely an “allegory of earthly kings and nothing else.” The pedagogy of
intimidation and terror is no longer effective. On the contrary, it blocks
entry into the Church to many who are seeking a God of Love “who loves
mankind” (the “Philanthropos” of the Orthodox liturgy).  
A holy monk of Mount Athos,20 a staretz who was almost our contemporary wrote
the following, addressed to every Christian: “If the Lord saved you along with
the entire multitude of your brethren, and one of the enemies of Christ and
the Church remained in the outer darkness, would you not, along with all the
others, set yourself to imploring the Lord to save this one unrepentant
brother? If you would not beseech Him day and night, then your heart is of
iron – but there is no  
need for iron in paradise.”  
And St. Paul, who was so truly united to Christ that he was able to affirm:
“It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me,” – did he not say
that he was ready to be “separated from Christ for his brothers?”  
Must not each of us plead with the Lord in the same way: May all my brothers
be saved along with me! Or otherwise, may I also be damned along with them!
Does not our Lord also wait for us to pray such a prayer? And would not this
prayer also be the solution to the ‘problem’ of hell and damnation?

“We need to understand human being and agency not as a limit to God—created by
and as God’s act of self-limitation—but as existing within God’s freedom and
because of it, in absolute dependence on God’s supremacy. We need a way of
saying that God wills our free response and that our response is truly free
just because God wills it.”

In this sophisticted work Griffiths argues for a free-will annihilationism:
human beings are ultimately free to embrace sin and pass into the nothingness
from which they were created. What makes his arguments particularly
interesting—and surprising—is that he is a Roman Catholic who seeks to norm
his reflections by the infallible pronouncements of the Magisterium. With
Balthasar, Griffiths believes that we must pray for the salvation of all,
though he deems the prospect unlikely, although not impossible. He agrees with
the universalist that the traditional claim that God would resurrect the dead
in order to condemn them to everlasting perdition violates the revealed
character of God as infinite and absolute Love.

Regarding your series on St Isaac, which was englightening, I don’t see where
it shows that the two ideas are separated. You do say that St. Isaac doesn’t
go into God’s method for effecting everyone’s eventual choosing of Him, but
that doesn’t rule out pre-destination.

I’m sure Ilaria Ramelli’s recent tome “The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis” will become an essential standard.

I agree with the effects of seeing God ‘face to face.’ I question, though,
whether all will ever come to such a state. Is it possible to see God ‘face to
face’ if great delusions remain?

Dr Hart, is there any more where that came from? You’d be doing English
Letters a great service by publishing more of your short fiction. Truly, these
are some of the most exquisitely written, moving stories I’ve ever read.

As it happens, the next work of technical theology I plan to write is on
precisely that topic. Unfortunately, I have been very ill these past 15
months, so I do not know when or if I shall write it. But my translation, I
hope, will come to be thought of as The Apokatastatic Standard Version.

By the way, the picture of free will advanced here is essentially that of
Maximus the Confessor.

Andreano identifies the misconceptions many people have about what
universalists believe and answers the common objections advanced against the
greater hope.

‘Divine’ agency can’t be reduced to the traditional terms (determinism,
libertarianism, etc.), but do we need to (indeed, can we?) step altogether
outside these categories to imagine ‘human’ transformation or to agree both
that we possess a God-given power to “interrupt” (to say ‘no’ to) our movement
toward God and that we are “determined” for God as our final end (i.e., cannot
conceivably rest finally in any other end)? I’m curious to know if part of the
answer lies in your “however gradually.” If we’re abandoning the categories of
determinism and libertarianism as a valid way to conceive of the will’s role
in human transformation, why should it take God any time at all to effect the
desired end? It would seem, if we suppose the transformation occurs “however
gradually,” that we’re assuming humans retain (even in our state of final
judgment) something of their power to interrupt the natural movement Godward.

A helpful introduction to universalist reflection in the patristic Church,
with special focus on Origen, St Gregory of Nazianzus, and St Gregory of
Nyssa.

Yes, you, John Milbank, William Desmond.  
When I’m in the mood for a little light reading . . .

My over all problem with all will be saved, is that the agape we know in God
the Holy Trinity is not coercive.

My question (possibly related to your comment above on the gnomic will and its
ultimate indistinction from the natural will) has to do with created agency as
fulfilled in Christ and enjoying a ‘scope of loving possibilities’ within
which to freely/creatively determine how it shall reflect divine beauties.
Going with Certeau’s suggestion, might we imagine the logoi of created beings
as embodying or specifying a “range” or “scope” (a pallet?) of beautiful
expression and not the particular of every form? The divine will (or logoi)
would terminate not in the final form of creaturely expression but in the
range of creative possibilities offered to creatures to uniquely shape their
expressive form (unique not in the creation of beauties not already comprised
in Christ as the summum bonum, but simply as the creature’s contribution to
the consummate beauty of ends synergistically achieved). Would the gnomic will
retain a unique function in this case?

Brian Moore–theologian, philosopher, poet, storyteller–has been a gift to
Eclectic Orthodoxy. He has a unique gift to bring to light dimensions of
reality that we usually miss. This article on the greater hope is one of the
finest pieces published on my blog.

Bernier is a Byzantine Catholic theologian. In this thoughtful piece, he asks
the question why should we question the doctrine of everlasting damnation. His
answer is blunt: we must question it because it is “mon­strous, plain and
simple.”

William Lane Craig has sought to rebut the claim that the Blessed cannot enjoy
perfect happiness if there is a hell by suggesting that they will be so
enraptured by their vision of God that they will not give the damned a second
thought. But how is this not a failure to love?

A different kind of devil altogether. If you like “The House of Apollo,”
incidentally, by that alone you can gain entrance to paradise–without even
having to go through the Tollhouses.

But I don’t want to be understood as suggesting that epistemic distance in
hell is just this world’s context reconstructed in which we comfortably
continue to pursue our careers. I think if we take the sufferings of hell to
be commensurate with “will’s” depth of solidification in evil and our coming
to terms with this, then we don’t have to affirm UR at the expense of free
agency. That is, if the ‘will’ has a share (by either persisting in its ‘no’
and thus suffering OR embracing the truth of its history with a ‘yes’) in the
uncovering of the truth about God and ourselves that steadily renders our
saying ‘no’ to God finally impossible, then I’m OK with that. That is, hell
confronts us, truth by truth, with our whole history which we are free to
accept or reject. And the death of every false self will be unspeakable
torment as we are left to experience the truth of our choices. Ouch. But as we
choose to embrace the truth, we become more free. Eventually we are wholly and
completely God’s. And the journey from one to the other will be the journey
from experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as torment to
experiencing the truth of ourselves in God’s presence as beatitude. The
difference between heaven and hell isn’t geography, it’s perspective. The
truth that once tormented us becomes the truth that glorifies us.

And tonight I read the parallel passage in MacDonald’s sermon, “Love your
neighbor,” that DBH referred us to. It sounds so similar to your heart and got
me thinking, too, that if Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and
FOREVER, then the parable of the lost sheep is a potent universalist passage!
So MacDonald:

You may be interested to know that I was a typical Evangelical, believing that
either heaven or hell was the destination of every human being, but came to
believe that everyone is going to heaven strictly by reading the Bible. That
is, I have never read a book on Universalism – either before or after I came
to this conclusion.

In simple terms, if a deranged man chooses to slash himself with a knife or
set fire to himself, you would not be interfering with his “freedom” by
preventing him from doing so. You would be rescuing him from his slavery to
madness. This is why the free-will defense of the idea of an eternal hell is
essentially gibberish.

But I cannot put dismiss Sergius Bulgakov’s suggestion that it is the world
that allows Satan to entertain his delusion that God is not his true good. But
eventually he will be expelled from the world and deprived of the world. He
will no longer have the world to “feed” on. At this point “Satan’s duel with
God begins,” Bulgavkov writes. “Can we, human beings, know anything about this
duel?”

Like you, St. Isaac had a huge influence on me, hence my baptismal name.
Nobody here will turn you away for that. It is a great, thoughtful and
welcoming community that will be happy to have you.

At the end of his life, the notable Lutheran theologian Robert W. Jenson came
to affirm universal salvation. For those acquainted with his theology, this
was not a surprise. The entirety of his project inevitably points to this
conclusion.

Thomas Allin, D.D., lived at a time when it was not unusual for an Anglican
parish priest to also be an eminent scholar. He also lived at a time when a
growing number of British Protestants were challenging the received doctrine
of everlasting damnation. _Christ Triumphant_ is a classic work of this period
and is noteworthy for its presentation of the patristic witness to the larger
hope, as well as its strong theological case for the greater hope. Highly
recommended.

The gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a message of
triumph and unconquerable hope: God will reconcile all sinners to himself in
the eschatological transfiguration of the cosmos. This hope therefore
authorizes preachers to proclaim the gospel in the performative mode of
unconditional promise. This paper was delivered at a conference in Cardiff,
Wales in 2014 and subsequently [published in the journal _Logos_
(2017)](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/preaching-
apokatastasis.pdf).

Jordan Wood, “[The Remarkable Unity of Rhetoric and Dialectic in _That All
Shall Be Saved_](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/the-remarkable-
unity-of-rhetoric-and-dialectic-in-david-harts-that-all-shall-be-saved/)”

Let me try to clarify. Let’s reserve ‘freedom’ for that mode of human agency
fulfilled and glorified in God, our truest freedom in Christ. Let ‘agency’
describe that mode of the will en route to such freedom. I’m suggesting only
that the latter be characterized by a certain epistemic distance/space and
that this distance serves a good purpose, namely, it’s an essential part of
what makes it possible for finite created beings such as ourselves to come to
be free (in the former sense) in God. So ‘freedom’ is the result of a
particular exercise of an ‘agency’ that is sufficiently informed but not
overwhelmed as such.

“Simply said, all things are determined to an end, a final cause, and will
reach that end, and hence fulfillment, unless some unnatural interruption
prevents them; but rational nature is capable of interrupting itself. Still,
willy-nilly, all natural wills return to God, and know the fire of glory as
bliss or torment, but even that torment is a knowledge of truth that cannot
not convert the will, however gradually, to its true end. Otherwise God will
never be all in all and creation will never be completed. That teleological
understanding of the will, and of its relation to nature, simply cannot be
forced into the categories of libertarian or determinist thinking, and I
honestly wish Christian theologians would stop using the Analytic categories
for that reason.”

Have you read “Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives”? In it, Elder Thaddeus
presents an image of heaven/hell that I don’t think fits into the “River of
Fire” or Divine Retribution categories.

This book contains most, though not all, of my articles (now revised) on
universal salvation. Enjoy!

For almost a millennia the Latin Church has taught that at the moment of death
the eternal destiny of the individual is definitively and irrevocably settled.
This doctrine is known as the [particular
judgment](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm). But the Eastern Church
has retained the older belief that the destiny of the damned is not settled
until the final judgment. Until then, salvation is still possible through the
prayers of the Church for the departed.

This recently published volume contains several essays by Bulgakov devoted to
eschatological and universalist themes. Many believe that this may be the best
introduction to Bulgakov’s theological vision.

Oh, and there is no “heresy of apokatastasis.” Unless you know of an
ecumenical council that, unlike the 5th, really proclaimed there is. If you
won’t call it a heresy, I won’t say anything similar of those whose theology
is so clearly a rejection of 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 11, not to mention
all of 1 Timothy.

I don’t dispute our groundedness in God, nor the undeniable primordial God-
given desire that animates the will (as David’s described), the act of every
act, nor that the end of whatever sort of agency/action it is by which means
we resolve ourselves shall finally end in a perfect and irrevocable harmony
with God.

Right. There’s no value in ignorance per se. I’m only suggesting that the
‘becoming’ of human beings toward their final telos in God be characterized by
choosing which is a choice between alternatives, and not a single inevitable
choice given to them by God (which, I confess, is how I read some construals
of universalism). Does that help at all?

Gustave Martelet “Hell,” Encyclopedia of Christian Theology, Vol. 1, edited by
Jean-Yves Lacoste, (New York: Routledge, 2005), 693.

“But it is a wild question. God is, and shall be, All in all. Father of our
brothers and sisters! You will not be less glorious than we, taught of Christ,
are able to think You. When You go into the wilderness and seek, You will not
come home until you have found. It is because we hope not for them in You, not
knowing Your love, that we are so hard and so heartless to the brothers and
sisters You have given us.”

First, note that what is being rejected in those two anathemas is not
universalism. The first rejects pre-existence of souls without bodies, in a
primal and undifferentiated community of monads. The second rejects an
ultimate disappearance both of bodies and of individual identity in a unity
rather of the sort asserted by bar Sudhaili, where gnosis (the single shared
knowledge of God and souls) is indistinguishable from the hypostasis (the
substance) of souls. Neither was a teaching of Origen’s, actually (Origen
taught pre-existence, but not actual bodilessness).

Keith DeRose is not a biblical scholar. He is a philosopher at Yale
University. Like Tom Talbott, he believes that the Apostle Paul ultimately
taught a doctrine of uni­versal salvation. He begins his article with this
judgment: “Contrary to what many would suppose, universalism … receives strong
scriptural support in the New Testament. Indeed, I judge the support strong
enough that if I had to choose between universalism and anti-universalism as
the ‘position of Scripture,’ I’d pick universalism as the fairly clear
winner.” I certainly would not say a “clear winner,” but the case is stronger
than many believe.

My blog has become somewhat “infamous” for its promulgation of the
universalist hope. You may find of interest my series on **[St Isaac the
Syrian](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/st-isaac-the-syrian-the-
triumph-of-the-kingdom-over-gehenna/)** and **[Sergius
Bulgakov](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/sergius-bulgakov-the-
irresistible-truth-of-final-judgment/)**. They aren’t scholarly pieces. If you
have a chance to glance at them, I’d welcome your feedback.

As for how the fall occurred, no theologian has ever given a satisfactory
theory. But that word “perfect” is misplaced. By definition, nothing temporal
is “perfect” in its origin (unless by origin one means the divine intention
for that being).

Ah, yes, I like this:  
“Perhaps God pursue us ‘as long as it takes’?”  
For many decades I have inclined toward a universalist view, pretty much since
reading Hosea Ballou’s “Ancient History of Universalism” (a mid-19th century
volume that I still have, buried somewhere in my library). “Inclined” as I do
not believe there is adequate conclusive evidence, either in Scripture or
Tradition, that any of us are qualified to claim knowledge of what is the
reality of “the other side”. I do believe in Hell, but I don’t know what I
believe about it. I do believe in the possibility of a permanent rejection of
God, but find it very difficult to believe that anyone (even including him
that once was Lucifer) can hold out against increasing knowledge through all
eternity,  
and I have become convinced that something resembling Purgatory has a far
greater likelihood than does an eternal hell. God’s mercy is infinite, He
desireth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should live. All that
being said, the operative thought is that we simply cannot know, not having
been conclusively told, but that we can certainly trust and hope in that
boundless mercy. It is not so much what we do with our free will, but what
Jesus has done on the Cross that matters. If He has declared us saved, so we
are, but if our flawed and twisted will has not accepted that, perhaps his
call and his teaching will ultimately bring us to a place of healing. There is
time enough and more. Perhaps it’s like what my Dad always said about how he
came to be married: “She kept on chasing me … until I caught her.”  
cf. Francis Thomson’s. “Hound of Heaven”>

To be honest, the rhetoric is stirring, but I find the reasoning a little
banal, for the reasons I have already enunciated. And exegetically poor. It
reduces freedom to mere libertarian optionalism (to use some jargon) and God
to an option among options (a thing among things). It is a defense of an
indefensible doctrinal tradition, heroic but hopeless.

2) If it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s gift throughout their
whole life in this world, why is it not possible for a human person to
continue to do so after he or she has has died? I suppose, ultimately, I don’t
understand why, if it is possible for a human person to refuse God’s offer
once, it is not possible for them to refuse it on and on for the rest of their
existence. I don’t in anyway think that people must do that. I don’t see why
it’s not a possibility though.

– On the one hand, “rational nature is capable of interrupting itself” of
preventing its movement toward its natural end in God.

Is the “freedom” to sell yourself into slavery or lock yourself in a cage
actual freedom? It seems more like a limitation of the will to me.

The traditional view says no. Death finalizes the sinner’s orientation to God.
But why believe this is so? All explanations seem fatuous and unconvincing.
They presuppose the doctrine of everlasting damnation. In this piece I
summarize the view of the great Sergius Bulgakov. Bulgakov dismisses the
school opinion that death freezes the human person: “the disincarnation in
death does not suppress the activity of the spirit.” The afterlife presents
new possibilities!

Following Louth’s lead, it seems like early Maximos assigns a gnomic will to
Christ (since, if we have one, Christ must have a gnomic will, lest what is
not assumed is not healed) and then later, denies it (because he sees it as a
dysfunction). But in positing the gnomic will as a ‘third moment,’ you not
only take the conversation a good leap forward, but also open up our
imaginations to revisit Gethsemane, where ‘Not my will, but thine,’ reveals
that third moment in Christ. Non? Oui?

Written a decade after his _Theandros_ essay, and taking into account more
recent scholarship, Andreapoulos elaborates on the eschatological perspectives
of St Maximus. As in his earlier essay, he believes that the logic of
Maximus’s ontological and anthropological reflections leave open the
possibility of universal salvation. Regarding apokatastasis Andreapoulos
concludes:

But what is crystal clear is that the will of a baptized person is free, and
that freedom is ontologically a property of the will. And it is also crystal
clear that as our will is sanctified, glorified, deified–whatever term you
want to use–in Glory–and that it nevertheless is in the ontological sense,
*FREE*.

Now I may be very wrong in my attempts to speak of what Austin Farrer calls
“double agency,” but it is also very wrong to call it heresy. The Orthodox
Church hasn’t even considered this difficult question at the depth it needs to
be considered before any such judgment can be made. But let’s assume the
libertarians are right. We can still proclaim the universalist hope: see
“[What are the Odds?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/universal-
salvation-what-are-the-odds/)” Hope this helps.

Fr. Aiden, if I might also include this beautiful quote from Catholic
theologian, Gustave Martelet, at the end of his article on hell in the ECT:

Since its publication in 1899, this book has been the standard historical work
on the universalist sympathies of the Church Fathers. Its scholarship is
dated—it should be read alongside Ramelli’s _The Christian Doctrine of
Apokatastasis_ —but it remains a useful resource. An online version can be
found at [Tentmaker.org](https://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html).

I am truly gratified you think well of my writing. Certainly, I would welcome
a venue to share my thoughts.

Weighing in at over 900 pages, this is a massive work of first-rate
scholarship on the theme of universal salvation in the first millennium
Christian Church. This book is now mandatory reading for anyone who wishes to
advance an opinion about what the Church Fathers believed and taught. You will
be surprised. The universalist hope was far more prevalent than I ever knew.
It was not restricted to Origen and St Gregory of Nyssa. Even St Augustine
apparently believed in a form of apocatastasis early in his episcopal career.
Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the standard
teaching of everlasting perdition became the teaching of the Church.

The question of everlasting damnation does not possess the status of
infallibility because it directly contradicts the revealed truth of divine
love and goodness and the “happy ending” promised by the gospel of Jesus
Christ.

In modern times some Orthodox have begun to claim that all local synods and
councils are doctrinal authoritative and so Orthodoxy has just as many exact
doctrinal formulae as Rome. Call it magisterium-envy. But in fact the ancient
canonical view is that only an ecumenical council can ratify a synod as
doctrinally binding. And it’s been a while, you know.

Macrina seems rather hopeful, even for the demons [whatever they are]. And
this not without some warrant from Colossians 1, where even that which is
invisible is reconciled by his blood (and what might that be?) … and yet
Hebrews says that Christ came for the help of humans and specifically not
angels. And anyway, by the time we get to the desert fathers, ‘demons’ starts
taking on less of a ‘fallen angels’ backstory and sounds a lot more like what
alcoholics say when they describe ‘wrestling with their demons.’ (Anthony
excepted). So what to make of it?

This discussion should go down in the annals of the blogosphere as the most
intellectually complex discussion ever to be pursued in the commentary section
of a blog. Thank you all very much!  
Unfortunately, I don’t have sufficient knowledge to participate in the
discussion. That is, I am too ignorant or, as most of you would probably put
it, I am too much lacking freedom.  
But perhaps that’s just because I’m catholic…

I still question the logic of a teleological approach leading inescapably to
universalism. Why is it not possible that some persons will never come to
regard God as their final Good and, thus, never freely choose Him? I agree
that true freedom is found in the true worship and service of God, but I do
not understand why some could not remain forever in the delusion that
something (or more likely someone?) other than God is their final Good. Am I
missing an element in the argument?

Thanks for the response, Mr. Hart. I do think it’s a helpful clarification
about God, and I think I agree with your basic description of God as man’s
final end.

This is powerfully imaged in the play, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.”
Spoiler alert: The version I saw ends with Judas condemned to hell, Christ
pleading with him even as Judas fades into a catatonic state, and Christ
remains with him. The lights dim as Jesus washes his feet.

Hi, Brad. Welcome to Eclectic Orthodoxy. I have your book sitting on my shelf,
but I haven’t read it yet. One of these days … 🙂

Part of the difficulty is that one should not isolate freedom and identity as
if one could focus purely on the individual. There’s the story in the
Brother’s Karamazov about the old woman in hell who once gave an onion to a
beggar. An angel tries to pull her out from infernal chains by the strength of
that single act of charity. Other souls try to cling to her and gain release
as well, and the old woman shouts, “it’s mine, mine” — and tumbles back into
the flames, of course. There is also Father Zossima’s mysterious claim that
“each is responsible for all.” This can only be an irrational puzzle for those
who have imbibed the ethos of modern, western individualism. But if the Triune
God is the exemplar of what it means to be a person, our creaturely experience
is analogous and only partially, incompletely, imperfectly approaches genuine
personhood.

Unfortunately, we lack an in-depth treatment of patristic eschatology
available in English. Perhaps such a work would be too much for any single
scholar; or perhaps someone has written such a volume, and it just hasn’t been
translated. Fortunately, we do have Brian Daley’s “handbook,” as he calls it.
Published in 2002, it remains the go-to book on the eschatological views of
the Church Fathers. It does need to be updated, though, in light of the recent
scholarly contributions of Ilaria Ramelli.

On p. 320, with reference to Michel de Certeau’s “Authorités Chrétiennes et
Structures Sociales,” you concede the possibility that in our final fulfilled
form Christ offers (in Certeau’s words) “a style of existence that ‘allows’
for a certain kind of creativity and that opens a new series of experiences”
as opposed to, say, Christ specifying every particular of our continuing
existence without remainder (even if, as you say, Christ comprises the
fullness of every contingent expression).

Do you enjoy analytic philosophical reflection on the hell? You’ll find a
number of interesting essays in this volume, including a piece by Talbott on
free will and character formation and a piece by Jerry Walls on
annihilationism. Check out the table of contents on the Amazon page.

That said, it also seems to me that in light of this, ‘will’ may not be the
locus of salvation in the first place, but rather the ‘nous.’ Briefly, worries
about coercion (the will of God imposed) or ‘free’ vs. ‘bondage’ of the human
will are all still fixated on the primacy of the will in salvation (whether
God’s or our own). However, what I in Scripture is that the divine Nous both
creates and enlightens the God-given human ‘nous’ (the eyes of the heart/mind,
poorly translated ‘intellect’) in order to ‘see the light of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ’ (2 Cor. 4) … something we cannot see as long as
we’re blinded by the god of this age. For whatever reason, some see in this
age and some do not (where ‘see’ is also a metaphor for love). Paul says that
apart from this ‘seeing,’ we cannot respond. And yet if we do ‘see,’ we are
capacitated for an uncoerced response.

I wanted to be Captain Kirk too, around 1975. L’hommes d’un certain age.

A helpful summary of the eschatological views of St Isaac of Nineveh.
Hryniewicz concludes his article with these words: “Today, after the twelve
centuries which have elapsed since the times of Isaac the Syrian, one reads
his texts with deep affection and sincere admiration. His universal hope makes
him one of the greatest guides and teachers, especially in theological
thinking about the world to come.”

Simply said, if it isn’t one of the promulgations of the seven councils, then
it’s nothing but the record of how certain clergymen at a certain time and
place understood the tradition (usually over against those blasted monks). And
then there is the question of what certain councils–the 5th of course–really
said.

I am not really wrestling with the text, at least not in a moral or
intellectual or existential sense. My only struggles are finding the _mot
juste_ (so to speak). I am, and have never concealed that I am, a complete and
unreserved universalist, and believe no other interpretation of Paul’s
theology is coherent. Geoffrey Wainwright’s review of my first book noted it,
for instance. Gregory of Nyssa, after all, succeeded where Augustine failed:
his eschatology incorporates the whole of the New Testament witness (sans
Revelation, which he did not regard as canonical) in a seamless synthesis,
without truncation, equivocation, or attempts to explain away the plain
meaning of crucial texts.

To definitively reject God is to choose the nothingness of evil. Some thoughts
on the free-will defense of hell, with special reference to Jonathan Kvanvig
and Eleonore Stump.

Jersak surveys the hymns of the Orthodox liturgies and offers this conclusion:
“Our kontakia and troparia, our typika and canons, are a continuous bold
declaration that what Christ accomplished through the Cross, his conquest into
hades and his glorious resurrection, was for all humanity, affects all
humanity and calls all humanity. They comprise the gospel announcement that
Christ is victorious over death and has raised up humanity with himself.”

Ummm… and I don’t mean to upset David, who is a friend and wonderful
theologian and philosopher (and thank God for that- I go mad wishing to help
Polkinghorne with some understanding of epistemology) but he writes splendidly
with his futuristic computer thing!

The question is based on an ontological confusion, and a naive
anthropomorphism. Sorry to sound arch, but you are not thinking of God as God.
Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot
simply turn away towards “something else.” He is the ground and end of all
desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not
choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire
anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good
and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual
appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee
God, you are desiring God as the “good end” you seek in godlessness. He is
inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are
God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but
an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural
will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don’t think of God as a candidate in
a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the
original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages,
since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will
is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an
object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.

If man was created perfect and free in this way, why did the Fall occur then?
If man (freely and) necessarily chooses good in prelapsarian state, how is the
Fall even possible?

“Tragically, thanks in large part to Augustine in the West and the Emperor
Justinian in the East, the universalist hope was suppressed and the teaching
of eternal perdition became the teaching of the Church.”

If I have questions, they are not about “freedom” as you’ve described it. They
are about the nature of the words “insofar as one’s actions bring one closer
to….” Is there not a conversation to be had here, i.e., about what sort of
agency or action it is which is the means by which we are to become free?
That’s what I’ve been inquiring after, and it’s only with respect to this that
I’d cautiously employ a term like “libertarian”; not to describe a proper
final mode or resting place for the will, but only to understand the nature of
the agency or action by which means we become free (and thus free of
‘libertarian’ becoming).

Yaakov, I cannot imagine myself commending to parishioners, either in a homily
or by way of spiritual counsel, that they adopt St Antony’s prayer “All will
be saved except I.” Perhaps certain ascetics can **safely** adopt such a
prayer, but I do not think that most ordinary believers can. It seems to
violate the gospel-word of unconditional love and would too easily generate
despair and scrupulosity.

Harmon examines how Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St Gregory of Nyssa
sought to ground their hope for universal salvation in the biblical story and
their reading of Holy Scripture.

Hi, everyone. I am temporarily closing the comments on this page. It really is
not intended for extended discussion, but I allowed it to continue because we
often do not get a visitor of the intellectual caliber of David Hart. My
special thanks to David for addressing our many questions.

God can guarantee the conversion of the wicked by bestowing upon them a
perfect vision of himself as the Good.

Here is my book-length treatment of the subject: [The Biblical Case for
Everyone Going to Heaven](http://wp.me/PNthc-i6)

Oh, I forgot, he quotes a bad translation of Gregory’s De infantibus too. Fr
John, read the Greek, in the Gregorii Nysseni Opera of Jaeger et al. On Cyril
and Athanasius, the arguments of various scholars on ther “disposition” is a
subtle but fascinating one, and Ramelli is actually quite good on that.

As for Princeton, it is all a matter of health. I’m afraid I don’t know
anything about the next two years. Kind of you to ask, though.

Dale, you may find my multi-article review of Tom Talbott’s book _The
Inescapable Love of God_ of interest. Several of these articles address New
Testament texts. The results are often surprising. And the comment threads are
quite interesting, too! <https://goo.gl/BrsRp9>

I now see that David responded to that in his comments above. Thank you.

This is an important essay (also included in revised form in _That All Shall
Be Saved_ ). Hart discusses the question of eternal damnation and theodicy and
comes down firmly in favor of the universalist vision of St Gregory of Nyssa.
Hart boldly declares that the Christian confession that God is absolute Love
and Goodness, when combined with the equally Christian confession that God has
freely created the world from nothing­ness, excludes the traditional expousal
of the eternal damnation of the wicked. If God is truly good, then he would
never accept the risk that even one of his beloved would be eternally lost.
Humanity has been made by God for God: “To see the good truly is to desire it
insatiably; not to desire it is not to have known it, and so never to have
been free to choose it.”

Finally! In this affordable volume Ramelli distills her years of research on
apokatastasis in the first- and early second-millennium into an accessible
format. During the first six centuries, the greater hope was alive and well in
many quarters of the Church. Must-buy, must-read.

This is entirely the wrong place to do it, but since I don’t know when I’ll be
within shouting distance of Dr. Hart again, I want to say that the moment in
“The Devil and Pierre Gernet” when Pierre’s soul is taken to heaven and the
demon bewails the “gross liberality of interpretation” with which God judges
man… well, that whole passage deserves to rank among the best universalist
texts of the last thousand years or so.

I might say here that even hopeful inclusivists so far unable to dogmatize
this universal hope are nevertheless obligated by love to hope and pray for
it, to the degree that the supposed alternatives (infernalism, conditional
immortality or annihilationism) are in principle untenable.

Kronen & Reitan analyze the philosophical case for annihilationism in light of
the arguments advanced in their book. Bottomline: annihilationism suffers from
many of the same flaws as does infernalism.

David, may I ask for your thoughts about the dogmatic authority with Orthodoxy
of the [Synodikon](https://sites.google.com/site/thetaboriclight/synodikon).
It is sometimes invoked as a decisive authority against the universalist hope.
This anathema in particular is cited:

There is no verse in the New Testament that unambiguously threatens eternal
punishment. There are three that are regularly invoked by the Hellfire Club
(my fond name for those who have some emotional commitment to the idea of a
hell of eternal torment), but none of them really says what they imagine it
says. Conversely, the seemingly very clear statements of universal salvation
number quite high (47 at my last casual count).

Somewhere in my library I have a mid-19thC volume of interest: “The Ancient
History of Universalism”, by Hosea Ballou. Ballou was a consistent Calvinist
who came to modify his position by a belief in universal election, and went on
to found the Universalist Church, which, regrettably developed to an extreme
liberalism and has merged with the Unitarians. His book is interesting, adding
to a Scriptural exposition a surprising knowledge of patristics. I’ve read it
through more than once, and find myself not convinced of universalism as a
doctrine. I don’t think we can go that far. But it did leave me ready to hold
a universalist hope similar to many of those you quote.

This 3-article series represents a recently revised and expanded blog version
of the above Cardiff lecture. How does apokatastasis shape and inform our
preaching of the gospel? How does it fit in with the Orthodox understanding of
Church as manifestation of the Kingdom?

There is also a Russian and a Greek parish in the Princeton area, but they
have very few converts.

Roberto De La Noval, “[We Shall See Him As He Is: Bulgakov On Eschatological
Conversion](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/we-shall-see-him-as-he-
is-bulgakov-on-eschatological-conversion/).”

If human beings are made by God and for God, if the Holy Trinity is their
ultimate Good, only in whom they may find the happiness they desire toward
whom their consciousness is teleologically directed, then we may not entertain
the possibility that they could irrevocably close themselves off to Love.
God’s salvific will cannot be eternally stymied. _That All Shall Be Saved_ has
brought apokatastasis back to the catholic table. See my series which seeks to
explicate Hart’s arguments: “[Apprehending
Apokatastasis](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/apprehending-
apokatastasis-the-incoherence-of-everlasting-perdition/).”

As for quoting the anathemas of the 5th Council: again, the council never
really had anything to do with them, they are a separate and irregular set of
condemnations, and even so they do not condemn universalism as such, and if
one cannot see that clearly then one is not reading the text, but only one’s
prejudices through the text.

Thank you for bringing my attention to this book. I’m going to have to borrow
it through ILL.

The Synodikon is just a compendium, and at times a converses, and possesses
only as much authority as what it is quoting at any point. In itself it is no
more binding on the conscience of an Orthodox than the Baltimore Catechism or
a Thomist manual is on the conscience of a Catholic.

Also, let me confess that I am not well-read in universalism, so my responses
can’t be entirely fair to y’all as I’m not working from a lot of the common
source material. That being said, I find this conversation very interesting
and will continue to read up on the question.

True. But which of my books, I ask myself, do you mean? Buy them all, I say.

Gregory MacDonald is the pseudonym for Robin Parry, who has a Ph.D. in Old
Testament studies. Parry looks at the primary New Testament texts that are
typically invoked in the eternal hell vs. universalism debate. You may be
surprised by how well the new Testament reads when liberated from a prior
dogmatic commitment to the classical doctrine of hell. Parry’s exegesis is
thoughtful, careful, and imaginative. He does not claim more for his
interpretation of a given text than it can bear; but he does invite us to a
fresh re-reading of the Bible through a hermeneutic of love.

The figure of Judas Iscariot has long captured the imagination of Christians,
even begetting poems and songs. Hart reflects on one forgotten poem by a
forgotten English poet, Robert Buchanan. If Jesus is love, is he not awaiting
the return of his friend and disciple at the messianic banquet?

Well, honestly, I know of no universalist of the classical variety who
suggests anything other than that purgative regeneration of the will. I am not
sure what the issue is.

I’m fascinated by the force of fiction to open a way to such hope: Would CS
Lewis, Great Divorce count, as least as the first step across the bridge?

If you happen to visit these comments again, I am curious to know your
response to those who claim that the belief in universalism is a heresy since
it was (supposedly) condemned by the fifth ecumenical council.

Personhood is not simply a given, but a task. At minimum, we should recognize
that the relational dimension of the person is just as constitutive of
identity as what one might think of as a “substantial core.” Or, if I can cite
Desmond once more, there is a porosity to personal being both in terms of the
deep structure of the soul and our natural openness to the exterior other. We
are “wholes” in our irreplaceable singularity that paradoxically realize our
integrity through dyanamic, dramatic interaction with the Other (an
interaction with the infinite capacity for novelty — the eternal is not
synonymous with closure or some kind of totalizing completion.)

The benefit of this view is that it still agrees with Jesus’ saying of, “No
one comes to the Father except through me” and allows for a Christian world
view when it comes to the potential of universalism. It’s not that all faiths
and religions lead to the same God, but that they could bring up different
aspects of Christianity that when Christ does return, they could recognize the
Jesus was the one all along, and the Holy Spirit has been wooing them all
along, and the Creator Covenant God does desire to be in relationship with us
all.

Chenoweth surveys the key texts in St Maximus’s writings and concludes that if
he was not an outright universalist, he was certainly sympathetic to it.
Superficially Maximus appears to have affirmed universal damnation, yet there
are many elements in his theology that point to apokatastasis.

That it may generate despair and scrupulosity, I’ll give you that. But that it
violates unconditional love? I don’t understand that. If anything, it
generates and exhibits a spirit of humility, love, and forgiveness.

Excellent list. Don’t forget Julian of Norwich! I got started on the path to
full-blown universalism through her, especially in chapter 32 when the Lord
said, “I will preserve My word at every point, and I will make everything well
that is not well.” The fact that He refused to disclose the Great Deed that He
shall do on the Last Day to make all things well inspires us to love, pray,
and hope with complete trust and confidence.

The greater hope is ultimately grounded in a vision of God as absolute,
unconditional Love. If this vision is true, then the doctrine of everlasting
damnation becomes both incomprehensible and morally intolerable.

As a former Protestant, I can testify to the radical difference (at least
existentially) between living in the cacophony of the confessions, which
distinguished and perpetrated divisions and prescribed bounded sets as to what
we had to believe (including infernalism) … vis-a-vis my Orthodox experience
of the creeds as centered sets around which we unify, which also limit what we
may impose on others and allow for a freedom of theological thought and
discourse (that I see here).

Belt is not a patristic scholar and certainly not an expert on St Maximus (who
is?), but he is a thoughtful reader and theologian. In this article he
reflects on Maximus’s _Ambiguum_ 7 and wonders whether Maximus’ metaphysics
and understanding of God logically leads to universal salvation, even if the
great Church Father never connected the dots.

Whether Universalism is correct or not, isn’t believing in Universalism
inherently dangerous, since you include yourself? Isn’t safe route is to
believe like St. Anthony the Great that “all will be saved, only I will
perish”?

Even so, I still cannot grant the liceity of the way you formulate freedom.
Part of it is that there is a difference between being “informed” in the
modern sense (possessing “information” and then, in a second movement of
deliberation, deciding upon it based upon some distinct set of criteria) and
being truly “in-formed” in the classical sense of being reshaped by the glory
of God. God is not a species of cognitive information in the former sense,
some finite object available to my judicious gaze. To know God is to be
transfigured into what is revealed. At that point of truest liberty, freedom
and necessity are no longer distinguished, any more than they are in the
Father’s own love of his own essence in the Son and Spirit. Remember, the only
thing to which Paul says we are predestined (well, marked out for in advance,
really) is to be conformed to the image of Christ. No less austerely apophatic
thinker than Maximus says that we achieve freedom (and are perfect as Christ’s
Father is perfect) when all distance (diastema) disappears and we rush into
the embrace of love.

Sebastian Brock is one of the foremost scholars in the world on Syriac
Christianity. This essay is particularly valuable for the copious quotations
from St Isaac on the theme of apokatastasis. If you are unable to purchase the

(in which his eschatological homilies are contained), then you definitely want
to read this paper.

I have always liked Mr. Blessed’s work. It cheers my heart to hear this.

However, it does seem to me that God’s dealings with us (postmortem) cannot
reduce to his simply overwhelming us with truth to the degree that our saying
“no” to God is rendered impossible. So while it’s true that no choice made in
ignorance can be ‘free’ in the fullest sense, it’s also true that the sort of
‘becoming’ that moves us into participation in God can only be made within a
context of the right kind of epistemic distance (i.e., a context in which we
both know enough to choose rightly and are ignorant enough to manufacture a
false narrative in choosing wrongly—that this ‘distance’ defines the synergy
we value). But if epistemic distance is reduced to zero, does not synergy
reduce to determinism? I am inclined to universalism, but I think configuring
the human response to God in a way that guarantees it will be ‘yes’ is
problematic. So I tend just to say that God will pursue us as long as it takes
without positing a _terminus ad quem_.

Umm, well, not in earnest, you know. But, in retrospect, it might be my
favorite in the collection.

– On the other hand, that nature “cannot not convert…to its true end.”

I had a professor in seminary that spoke of one theory that arises from the
question, “What about the salvation of God’s chosen people the Jews? (for the
evangelicals) Those before Jesus that it was and could have been credited to
them salvation by faith). And the theory went something like this: When Jesus
returns EVERYONE is resurrected and every tongue confessing and every knee
bowing that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, Lord, and King. And it would be at
that point that the Jews would see the messiah coming in the way that they
have always been expecting. And everyone would be able to either recognize the
one and true God and choose to continue to be in relationship with the God, or
they would be wooed by the Holy Spirit to desire to start that relationship
beyond this life. And of course, for anyone that chooses to not be in
relationship with our three-fold Godhead, then there would be a place for them
that would not be in the presence and relationship with God, and that would be
like eternal torment to choose to not be in a relationship with the Trinity
that they were create to be in.

This article is one of a series on the eschatology of Sergius Bulgakov. He
contends that in the final judgment, all will see the risen Christ and in
their hearts will know the One in whose image they were made and know, by
comparison, how far they have fallen from the Image. “It is impossible,”
declares Bulgakov, to appear before Christ and to see Him without loving him.”

It seems the heresy of apokatastasis presented here isn’t really molesting
Orthodox eschatology or soteriology as much as it cuts asunder the dogma of
Orthodox anthropology that says that baptized human persons have free will.

Do the Fathers differ on how free will and providence interact? Absolutely. Do
they differ on how grace and free will relates to “nature” of a person?
Absolutely. Are there various interpretations about how the post-lapsarian
will is wounded? Absolutely. Various interpretations about how a free will
really operates in the eschaton? Absolutely.

Think of Ware as the Orthodox counterpart to Balthasar on the topic of the
universa­list hope. Like Balthasar, he does not believe we can affirm anything
stronger than a hope. In Ware’s judgment there is no way to rationally resolve
the irresolvable conflict between divine love and human freedom. All we can do
is to firmly hold them together in tension, “while admitting that the manner
of their ultimate harmonization remains a mystery beyond our present
comprehension.”

Either we have free will now with the ability to permanently and eternally
reject God, and God efficaciously and therefore irresistibly changes the human
will in the eschaton to choose God permanently, *OR* we don’t have free will
now, and the change that God does upon us in the eschaton gives us will that
is truly free and we thus choose God freely for eternally.

Both of these fly in the face of the faith delivered once and for all that
says that a baptized human person has free will now, *AND* will have free will
in the eschaton.

Fr. Aiden, and perhaps even David Hart, if one or both would do me the honor
of helping me with a confusion I am having in regards to apokatastasis.  
First, an little background, I have not been received in the church, am merely
a pilgrim searching for truth, but the E.O. church saved my faith a few years
ago and has enlightened much of my theology since then, But I haven’t been
able to make the leap yet, which allows me a large berth in my eclecticness,
but the idea of joining is always in the back of my mind, and so I am always
trying to align myself, the best I can to the church, and so with that, in
regards to this, I thought the church condemned this at the 5th ecumenical
council if I may copy and paste from orthodoxwiki:  
– If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the
monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema. (First
anathema against Origen)  
-If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united in one, when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall have disappeared, and that the knowledge of the world to come will carry with it the ruin of the worlds, and the rejection of bodies as also the abolition of [all] names, and that there shall be finally an identity of the γνῶσις and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema. (Fourteenth anathema against Origen)2

Is it coherent and rational to think that a fully informed and free
person–i.e., someone who both fully understands that God is his supreme good
and is free from delusion and bondage to disordered desires–would irrevocably
reject absolute Love? Talbott doesn’t think so.

The One Purpose of God: An Answer to the Doctrine of Eternal Punishment by Jan
Bonda

Bulgakov’s is the most profound vision of the greater hope that I have read.

I wouldn’t suggest that the more ignorant we are the more free we are.
Epistemic distance is qualified on both ends. It can’t be maximized, for then
we would be absolutely ignorant and incapable of choosing God. We have to be
sufficiently informed, obviously. But can the distance be reduced to zero, in
which case we would be so informed, so overwhelmed by the truth, that no
possible means of constructing a ‘no’ to God would be possible?

Drawing on Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance, Paschall proposes that universal
salvation appropriately follows from God’s election of humanity in Jesus
Christ.

Dear me, you really think those are interpolations? That is something of a
joke in scholarly circles. Especially since it would basically mean that
Gregory’s whole theology, from the ground up, as unfolded in De anima et
resurrectione and De hominis opificio and the Great Oration and the Psalms
commentary is an interpolation. Maybe Gregory never really wrote anything
(rather like the Oxfordian hyposthesis about Shakespeare). Something similar
is true in Isaac’s case. And those two are far from being the only patristic
universalists; both of the very distinct Alexandrian (including Cappadocian)
and Antiochene tradition are full of them, from the days of Pantaenus to the
13th century writings of Solomon of Bostra. Goodness, there are almost
overwhelming reasons to believe Gregory Nazianzen, and even Athanasius and
Cyril of Alexandria, were so disposed (Gregory unquestionably, really).

I hope that you, Fr. Kimel, and the many other universalists and hopeful
universalists out there continue to engage in the conversation.

Also it seems to me what you are saying is logically confused. Given certain
assumptions about God (the ones being made in this thread), either God is the
final Good (Good in itself) or he is not. This means that the argument you
cannot avail yourself of is God is the final Good and something else is the
final Good as well. It amounts to saying there are two Gods. But if that is
right, then, strangely enough, there are no Gods, because something cannot be
God, as we understand him, and something else also be God. It amounts to
saying A and ~A which is logically contradictory. Moreover, if both are the
Good in itself, then it seems reasonable to suppose that they are essentially
identical which, according to a decent metaphysical principle, means there is
one final Good, not two.

My point is just that this journey, this movement toward our telos in God,
requires a synergy in which the specific human ‘yes’ and ‘no’ we render are
not guarantees entailed God’s actions in/toward us (which I tend to see
universalists appeal to in order get a clear terminus ad quem). Thus my
concern with ‘epistemic distance’. Some ignorance is a ‘good’ thing, because
it makes creaturely becoming in the Good possible.

In this fine piece, Klager articulates a cosmic eschatology grounded in
humanity’s ontological union with the Incarnate Word. He features St Gregory
of Nyssa, but he also draws on the Divine Liturgy and the ascetical tradition
on _theosi_ _s_. He concludes by affirming a universalist hope along the lines
advocated by Ware and Evdokimov.

You will have a few great options in the Princeton area. There are services
held every Sunday on campus. I myself attend Mother of God parish, which is a
few miles away from the university. It is a great parish that will soon be
moving into its new building. Here are the websites for both:

I heard a funny story by Kallistos Ware. He was embarking on a long drive with
another hierarch. He thought to pass the time he would bring this up. Will
even the demons be saved? To which the hierarch boomed, ‘None of your
business,’ and that was that for that topic. 🙂

DeRose asks the free-will defenders of hell: if God cannot save all, why at
least does he not save more than he does? DeRose distinguishes himself from
David Hart in that he cannot affirm that all, without exception, will
indubitably be saved; but he thinks it very, very, very likely.

But I would still say that the final formulation about epistemic ignorance is
defective. Taken to its logical terminus it would mean that we are free to the
degree that we are ignorant, whereas the point is that we become more free as
we progress away from illusion towards the Good as such and the fulfillment of
our nature. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Father,
forgive them, they know not what they do. Etc. And the highest freedom is
achieved when we at last see so clearly that there is no need for choice,
because union in love has been reached.

A helpful summary of how the question of Satan’s ultimate salvation has been
addressed by Christian theologians down through the centuries. “From the
outset,” Patrides writes, “one element clearly emerges: the conviction that
God’s love is all-inclusive and irresistible. The crucial issue, which
orthodox theologians repeatedly failed to grasp, was never whether Satan
should be, or could be, redeemed, but whether Divine Love may be limited in
any way, even to the extent of Satan’s exclusion from Grace.”

Of course, one can then get into the old wrangles between Thomists and
Scotists over the priority of intellect or will in knowing God. And the
Scotists are routinely misrepresented in that regard, since for them intellect
is not the same as reason and will is not the same as spontaneous arbitrium;
both are rational movements of the soul. And really, after all, both are
really one and the same movement; they are not genuinely separable faculties.
Intellect is informed because it is intentional, and therefore has a natural
velleity towards the world and towards the transcendental horizon of truth.
Will is a rational movement towards a perceived end, and therefore naturally
follows (as best it can) the light of intellect. There really is no need here
to assign priority: the final end is a kingdom of love and knowledge, the two
proving to be infinitely identical

Fr Coleman, that is fascinating news! I had heard that Hart had been
commissioned to translate the NT (or the entire Bible?). I hope that Hart will
eventually share with the rest of us the conclusions of his study.

The question was a bit long, but thank you David for clarifying! Excellent.

I am convinced that this wonderful truth is knocking on the door of Christ’s
church and that we’re on the verge of a reformation of grace that will
ultimately eclipse the one introduced by Martin Luther. Consequently, I have
written and published a book, Dropping Hell and Embracing Grace, by Ivan A.
Rogers, available from Amazon.com, also on Kindle. The book has been well-
received; a welcome addition to the exciting discussion of universalism.

I know you said και τα λοιπα. But I’ll add, just for diligence sake, Rom.
9.16, 5.20.

Oh, I should have noted: the first anathema of “Origen” is clearly phrased:
what is rejected is a restoration whose premise is the pre-existent state of
souls, such that all things must return to the original state, without
personal or natural differentiation of souls. That is why it speaks of the
restoration “that follows from” or is “consequent upon” that pre-existence. I
think we often fail to appreciate that, even as late as the fifth council,
there were still too many of the “holy fathers” and too many participants in
the council who, at least sub rosa reservationis, held to an eventual
salvation of all for an outright and unambiguous condemnation of universal
salvation to have been possible.

George MacDonald’s sermon “Love Thy Neighbour” has a passage so reminiscent of
Silouan’s remark that it is almost difficult to keep them distinct in one’s
memory.

Desmond is a friend of mine, incidentally, and I do not know if I have ever
found cause to disagree with him on anything.

I see St. Silouan being cited all over the place as a Universalist. I’m
confused. Based on my reading (some time ago), his famous prayer was “all
creation will be saved, and I alone will perish”. I just don’t see how this is
espousing Unversalism – he is exluding himself.

If you’re just beginning to reflect on eternal damnation, this may be the book
with which to begin. Four Protestant scholars present the retributive,
annihilationist, free will, and universalist positions and respond to the
contributions of the others. Robin Parry’s essay on universalism is
particularly fine.

The New Testament only seems to clearly teach eternal damnation if it is read
through a hermeneutic of perdition. Its witness looks very different when read
through the paschal victory of Jesus Christ.

Brad J: As it happens, I ordered your book from amazon just yesterday. Looking
forward to getting it and reading it. I enjoyed a blog post of yours from some
time ago about (among other things) the two Gregorys.

For a helpful exposition of MacDonald’s views, see Thomas Talbott, “[Universal
Salvation in the Theology of George
MacDonald](http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/George%20MacDonald%20chapter.pdf).”
Regarding MacDonald’s speculations on how God might convert the wicked after
death, see my article “[The Hell of Self and the Redemption of the Outer
Darkness](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/the-hell-of-self-and-the-
redemption-of-the-outer-darkness/).”

“To those who accept and transmit the vain Greek teachings that there is a
pre-existence of souls and teach that all things were not produced and did not
come into existence out of non-being, that there is an end to the torment or a
restoration again of creation and of human affairs, meaning by such teachings
that the Kingdom of the Heavens is entirely perishable and fleeting, whereas
the Kingdom is eternal and indissoluble as Christ our God Himself taught and
delivered to us, and **as we have ascertained from the entire Old and New
Scripture, that the torment is unending and the Kingdom everlasting to those
who by such teachings both destroy themselves and become agents of eternal
condemnation to others** ,  
Anathema, Anathema, Anathema! [my emphasis].”

What I hear DBH and Fr. Aiden saying is that ultimate redemption need not be
seen as coercive if once the natural will is freed to pursue its natural
desire for God. It seems to me that the gnomic will is actually a dysfunction
of the will (and not the will per se) which must be either healed in order for
us to follow the desire of our natural wills for God … it also seems to me
that this cannot or will not happen for many or even most until we ‘see Christ
face to face.’ To punish someone for all eternity without the benefit of this
healing vision of the ‘serpent on the pole’ would seem very unjust. Hence my
hope in the mercy of Christ at the end.

The classic evangelical work on retributive annihilationism. Not a position
with which I am particularly sympathetic—the hermeneutics that grounds the
project is all wrong, but it contains a lot of useful information.

Nemes argues that despite the passages in the New Testament that threaten
eternal damnation, we do not in fact know whether hell will be eternally
populated. Hence we may confidently pray for the salvation of all.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

“God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us”  
Nobody is saying this. You are simply either refusing to listen to anything
said to you or out-and-out lying. How is it possible for an apparently
intelligent man dealing honestly to derive this statement from “God would not
do otherwise than save a person who would otherwise eternally suffer because
God is good.”? There is no connection between the two statements. You must
know this, you have been told this repeatedly, and yet just mindlessly repeat
the same lie: why?

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you
agree that Christ’s mission was not redemption from hell, but from sin. For
many, hell is the construct of God as a place of eternal punishment. However,
after reading your linked article
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/> it seems clear that you believe that hell is self inflicted.
You wrote “Hell being a real possibility is not God’s doing but mine.”

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

[“A man is nearer heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap
the reward of his doings” →](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/12/03/a-man-
is-nearer-heaven-when-in-deepest-hell-than-just-ere-he-begins-to-reap-the-

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

          * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a8385e40fc2827dafd1c87470970e04?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) David says:

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

[3] On this point I am indebted to several telephone and online discussions
with Jared Goff.

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:
<https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/hell-and-the-coherence-of-
christian-hope/>

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-
aquinas-on-creation-by-kevin-keane.pdf),” _Downside Review_ 95 (April 1975):
101.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us

Freedom](https://www.anselm.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Institute%20of%20SA%20Studies/4.5.3.2j_11Rogers.pdf),”
_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

Posted on [30 November
2022](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/universal-salvation-love-is-
its-own-necessity/ "4:01 pm") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil

hell from being eternally confined within it.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

“nothing is more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is

conscious torment.”

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

Emanation](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/aviccenac2b4s-julie-
swanstrom.pdf),” _Otrosiglo_ 1 (2017): 115-116.

[6] See Tobias Hoffman, “Freedom Without Choice: Medieval Theories of the
Essence of Freedom,” in _The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Ethics_ (2019),
pp. 194–216; and my article “[Avicenna and Aquinas: Ruminating Divine
Freedom](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/ruminating-divine-freedom-
and-necessity-avicenna-and-aquinas/).”

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

So might I imagine a thousand steps up from the darkness, each a little less
dark, a little nearer the light—but, ah, the weary way! He cannot come out
until he have paid the utter­most farthing! Repentance once begun, however,
may grow more and more rapid! If God once get a willing hold, if with but one
finger he touch the man’s self, swift as possibility will he draw him from the
darkness into the light. For that for which the forlorn, self-ruined wretch
was made, was to be a child of God, a partaker of the divine nature, an heir
of God and joint heir with Christ. Out of the abyss into which he cast
himself, refusing to be the heir of God, he must rise and be raised. To the
heart of God, the one and only goal of the human race—the refuge and home of
all and each, he must set out and go, or the last glimmer of humanity will die
from him. Whoever will live must cease to be a slave and become a child of
God. There is no half-way house of rest, where ungodliness may be dallied
with, nor prove quite fatal. Be they few or many cast into such prison as I
have endeavoured to imagine, there can be no deliverance for human soul,
whether in that prison or out of it, but in paying the last farthing, in
becoming lowly, penitent, self-refusing—so receiving the sonship, and learning
to cry, Father!

And the light would grow and grow across the awful gulf between the soul and
its haven—its repentance—for repentance is the first pressure of the bosom of
God; and in the twilight, struggling and faint, the man would feel, faint as
the twilight, another thought beside his, another thinking Something nigh his
dreary self—perhaps the man he had most wronged, most hated, most despised—and
would be glad that some one, whoever, was near him: the man he had most
injured, and was most ashamed to meet, would be a refuge from himself—oh, how
welcome!

I think I have seen from afar something of the final prison of all, the
innermost cell of the debtor of the universe; I will endeavour to convey what
I think it may be.

It is the vast outside; the ghastly dark beyond the gates of the city of which
God is the light—where the evil dogs go ranging, silent as the dark, for there
is no sound any more than sight. The time of signs is over. Every sense has
its signs, and they were all misused: there is no sense, no sign more—nothing
now by means of which to believe. The man wakes from the final struggle of
death, in absolute loneliness— such a loneliness as in the most miserable
moment of deserted childhood he never knew. Not a hint, not a shadow of
anything outside his consciousness reaches him. All is dark, dark and dumb; no
motion—not the breath of a wind! never a dream of change! not a scent from
far-off field! nothing to suggest being or thing besides the man himself, no
sign of God anywhere. God has so far withdrawn from the man, that he is
conscious only of that from which he has withdrawn. In the midst of the live
world he cared for nothing but himself; now in the dead world he is in God’s
prison, his own separated self. He would not believe in God because he never
saw God; now he doubts if there be such a thing as the face of a man—doubts if
he ever really saw one, ever anything more than dreamed of such a thing:—he
never came near enough to human being, to know what human being really was—so
may well doubt if human beings ever were, if ever he was one of them.

MacDonald will be one of those I seek out early to wash their feet. What a
heart and mind.

Can there be any way out of the misery? Will the soul that could not believe
in God, with all his lovely world around testifying of him, believe when shut
in the prison of its own lonely, weary all-and- nothing? It would for a time
try to believe that it was indeed nothing, a mere glow of the setting sun on a
cloud of dust, a paltry dream that dreamed itself—then, ah, if only the dream
might dream that it was no more! that would be the one thing to hope for.
Self-loathing, and that for no sin, from no repentance, from no vision of
better, would begin and grow and grow; and to what it might not come no soul
can tell—of essential, original misery, uncompromising self disgust! Only,
then, if a being be capable of self-disgust, is there not some room for
hope—as much as a pinch of earth in the cleft of a rock might yield for the
growth of a pine? Nay, there must be hope while there is existence; for where
there is existence there must be God; and God is for ever good, nor can be
other than good. But alas, the distance from the light! Such a soul is at the
farthest verge of life’s negation!—no, not the farthest! a man is nearer
heaven when in deepest hell than just ere he begins to reap the reward of his
doings—for he is in a condition to receive the smallest show of the life that
is, as a boon unspeakable. All his years in the world he received the endless
gifts of sun and air, earth and sea and human face divine, as things that came
to him because that was their way, and there was no one to prevent them; now
the poorest thinning of the darkness he would hail as men of old the glow of a
descending angel; it would be as a messenger from God. Not that he would think
of God! it takes long to think of God; but hope, not yet seeming hope, would
begin to dawn in his bosom, and the thinner darkness would be as a cave of
light, a refuge from the horrid self of which he used to be so proud.

But no liveliest human imagination could supply adequate representation of
what it would be to be left without a shadow of the presence of God. If God
gave it, man could not under­stand it: he knows neither God nor himself in the
way of the understanding. For not he who cares least about God was in this
world ever left as God could leave him. I doubt if any man could continue
following his wickedness from whom God had withdrawn.

The most frightful idea of what could, to his own consciousness, befall a man,
is that he should have to lead an existence with which God had nothing to do.
The thing could not be; for being that is caused, the causation ceasing, must
of necessity cease. It is always in, and never out of God, that we can live
and do. But I suppose the man so left that he seems to himself utterly alone,
yet, alas! with himself—smallest interchange of thought, feeblest contact of
existence, dullest reflection from other being, impossible: in such evil case
I believe the man would be glad to come in contact with the worst-loathed
insect: it would be a shape of life, something beyond and besides his own
huge, void, formless being! I imagine some such feeling in the prayer of the
devils for leave to go into the swine. His worst enemy, could he but be aware
of him, he would be ready to worship. For the misery would be not merely the
absence of all being other than his own self, but the fearful, endless,
unavoidable presence of that self. Without the correction, the reflection, the
support of other presences, being is not merely unsafe, it is a horror—for
anyone but God, who is his own being. For him whose idea is God’s, and the
image of God, his own being is far too fragmentary and imperfect to be
anything like good company. It is the lovely creatures God has made all around
us, in them giving us himself, that, until we know him, save us from the
frenzy of aloneness—for that aloneness is Self, Self, Self. The man who minds
only himself must at last go mad if God did not interfere.

A man may well imagine it impossible ever to think so unpleasantly of himself!
But he has only to let things go, and he will make it the real, right, natural
way to think of himself. True, all I have been saying is imaginary; but our
imagination is made to mirror truth; all the things that appear in it are more
or less after the model of things that are; I suspect it is the region whence
issues prophecy; and when we are true it will mirror nothing but truth. I deal
here with the same light and darkness the Lord dealt with, the same St. Paul
and St. John and St. Peter and St. Jude dealt with. Ask yourself whether the
faintest dawn of even physical light would not be welcome to such a soul as
some refuge from the dark of the justly hated self.

Next after doubt comes reasoning on the doubt: ‘The only one must be God! I
know no one but myself: I must myself be God—none else!’ Poor helpless dumb
devil!—his own glorious lord god! Yea, he will imagine himself that same
resistless force which, without his will, without his knowledge, is the law by
which the sun burns, and the stars keep their courses, the strength that
drives all the engines of the world. His fancy will give birth to a thousand
fancies, which will run riot like the mice in a house but just deserted: he
will call it creation, and his. Having no reality to set them beside, nothing
to correct them by; the measured order, harmonious relations, and sweet graces
of God’s world nowhere for him; what he thinks, will be, for lack of what God
thinks, the man’s realities: what others can he have! Soon, misery will beget
on imagination a thousand shapes of woe, which he will not be able to rule,
direct, or even distinguish from real presences—a whole world of miserable
contradictions and cold-fever-dreams.

“Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God on
the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that has
never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems may
literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair…Perfect hope
is achieved on the brink of despair.”

Frankly, this is not very convincing. (God may be good, as I understand good –
but if it turns out that he acts in a way that I can’t perceive as good, let’s
all agree that God is good, anyway.) This God of uncertain conduct hardly
seems trustworthy.

As both [Jeremiah Carey](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/31/universal-
salvation-a-response-to-fr-james-dominic-rooney/) and [Thomas
Talbott](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/james-dominic-rooneys-
critique-of-universalism/) have noted, Rooney needs to clearly define
causality in this context. Until corrected, I will assume that he is thinking
of a divine action (or series of actions) that serves as the sufficient
condition for the individual’s love of God.

“This is that you think God makes an eternal decision such that God cannot
have done otherwise than create and save human beings, because God being the
Good requires that He always act this way. This simply makes God dependent on
the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God has an essential
relation to the universe.”  
You are simply concatenating two different statements and pretending they are
the same to make a frankly disingenuous point. Whether God might not have
created, and whether God, having created human beings, and having seen them
fall into sin and death, might then abandon them to eternal torment, are
completely different questions, and your entire point about God’s “essential
relation to the universe” is about the first question, not the second.  
Your objection about saying God “cannot” also relies on slight of hand. God is
not God if there is nothing he cannot do, in the sense he is omnipotent – this
everyone agrees. The sense in which God “cannot” abandon his wayward children
to hell is, however, the same sense in which we say, with absolute Christian
orthodoxy, God “cannot” sin. Your position really seems to rely on the idea
that God is not inherently good, and to be God is free to be, and indeed might
be, good or evil as God chooses.  
You also seem to be asserting the position that God damns people to hell
according to some extrinsic purpose that we don’t know. If that were the case,
it would be the sinners in hell dying eternally whose sacrifice saved the
world, not Christ’s, which is scarcely Christian, and God would be exploiting
their eternal suffering for his own purposes, which is basically evil.  
Universalism is only necessarily true if God is good, and your arguments rely
on God capable of evil. And you call universalism heresy!

You wrote…  
“We should, therefore, first, reject any claim that we need to know God’s
reason to permit anyone to reject him. I do not need to know or be able to
prove that everyone is going to heaven in order to trust that God loves me,
will not abandon me, or that he will take care of my loved ones. I do not need
to know whether hell is empty to know that Christ comes to harrow the hell in
my heart, a hell that would be my eternity if I were not to cling to him.”

“I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.”

If the wind blows hard enough, a hanging apple will fall from the tree.

Sorry, to clarify, I meant we do not know whether it is possible God allows
*some to be actually lost* as opposed to the mere unactualized possibility.

Would deicide – killing Jesus on the cross – count objectively as an infinite
evil? Can anything outweigh that evil?

But then, Fr. Rooney, you contend that Christ may not be a sufficient bulwark
against yourself. Persons, you say, may apparently reject God for all
eternity.

I’d like to ask you a serious question – not intended in any way to be cheeky.

I do not claim God is freer for damning some, so that’s to misunderstand the
point. Here’s the nub: God is the source of being and we are not. If God must
save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the situation
where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God without us.
Both of these kind of views implicitly presuppose a pantheistic mixture of the
divine and human nature. Now, the fact that we always are contingent beings,
whose nature involves the possibility of sin, does not require that God
abandon us to that sin. But it does imply that all we have is received from
Him, freely and not deserved. This is a central claim of orthodox
Christianity, not a strange view of the divine freedom unique to myself or a
‘libertarian’ views of free will.

(The threat of hell secures the gratuity of grace? Can any argument be more
inane and perverse than that?)

Oh, and, incidentally once you’ve accepted that the Good is all that
positively exists and all that could ever possibly exist in any metaphysically
possible universe, then you have by that very belief accepted that “mixture”
you’re so frightened of, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. If
something is not already in its deepest essence of and one with the Good, it
simply doesn’t exist at all.

“I’ve argued that the possibility (of an eternal hell) is a necessary
component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not grace. That’s the serious
deep issue at the heart of this discussion.”

“does not end up with the knowledge that God must save all people, he does not
end up with the knowledge that Francis cannot end up rejecting God or that God
cannot do otherwise than save Francis. Instead, Francis’s fear leaves him
because, even if Francis cannot imagine what God will do, or how God will do
it, Francis comes to trust God. In that trust, he knows that nothing God will
ever let happen to him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.”

Here’s a possibility: it would have been possible for God to create a universe
in which nobody had ever sinned and in which the Holocaust never occurred. Do
you agree that God can do this? I do.

Now, you can suspect there is, I think, merely because you cannot imagine any
possible situation that could serve as a counterexample where God is good and
He allows hell, because you can see no good that could possibly come of it.
This is where, by contrast, I think we can be confident, trusting God that
there is some such good, if God were to permit hell to exist.

You insist, like universalists, that God is good. The critical difference is
the definition of good. Universalists proclaim that God’s character of
goodness and love precludes ultimate tragedy. Your view is that a good God
may, in fact, allow evil to reign and men to suffer eternal death.
Inexplicably, you argue that allowing His creation to suffer irreparable harm
would be an expression of God’s love and mercy – an expression of God’s
goodness even if we can’t imagine a reason that God could act in such a way.

The point is not the God must save us, but that if His character as revealed
in scripture is true we can have confident faith that He will save us, not out
of any compulsion or necessity but out of the outpouring of his love. If
something about the nature of creation means that we cannot have that faith,
it seems to me that is the view that is subjecting God to necessity. Freedom
Really Ain’t Unmet Desires (FRAUD) 🙂

So I hope you now see that it is not good enough for you to say that
Universalists are wrong because they cannot prove there is a ‘higher good’.
The status of any such good is in fact irrelevant.

If you touch a lighted match to a dry piece of paper, it will catch fire.

Nor is it a purely logical necessity if by that one has in mind what
philosophers generally take broadly speaking logical necessity to mean (prior
to the assumption of any other metaphysical worldview that would narrow the
scope), i.e., any proposition positing a state of affairs whose grammar does
not generate a contradiction in its terms.

I quote the above not to deflect our discussion into another topic, but simply
to point out the diversity of understandings of divine freedom and necessity.

If I choose to have children, the very act of having children commits me to
support them and love them for life – and it certainly prevents me from using
them as instruments to achieve some higher good.

“But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness. It’s not a
contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free that they
can do this.”

What I believe you mean is that not everything God can do would be justified
by production of greater goods. Utilitarianism is wrong because there are
intrinsically evil acts, like torture (Jack Bauer), so that intentionally
choosing to torture so as to achieve greater goods would be an evil act. But
this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires. You might think God is
omnipotent and can do literally anything. But God cannot – as you yourself
insist – given His being the Good itself. There are some actions which are
either logically impossible or impossible given God’s intentions to achieve
certain goods. But God can exist without us, so no logical contradiction, and
God can create humans without raising them to grace, so no problem on the
second option either.

Father Rooney, you seem to be skipping over most of the substantive points, so
I will try to restate them more succinctly:

“But this merely misrepresents the orthodox position on hell. On the orthodox
classical picture, God merely permits the evil of hell, but does not
positively intend it. So this objection misfires.”

If it rains hard and long enough, a river will pour over its banks and flood
the valley.

Most Christians will immediately balk at the unqualified suggestion that
anything deter­mines the life and activities of the Holy Trinity. In his
transcendence, aseity, eternality, and simplicity, God is absolute freedom.
Even his inner Trinitarian processions, as St Bonaventure puts it, may be
described as “natural and voluntary, free and necessary”2—free and voluntary,
because God is the infinite plenitude of being; natural and necessary, because
God eternally is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. For the Seraphic Doctor,
the voluntary is the most perfect mode of activity. Unlike St Thomas Aquinas,
therefore, he has no problem saying that the Father freely and necessarily
wills the begetting of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit.3

And yet, you insist that Francis or you or me or some of us or most of us may
possibly reject God’s grace forever, which is to be in a place of spiritual
death or an ultimately tragic or hopeless situation.

Yes, God would not be the Good if he were not good in all his actions. This
much is, I would hope, quite self-evident. He must by his nature will nothing
but the Good for all that is, was, and ever will be. To say therefore that he
must save that which he creates is simply the rather banal observation that
God must be himself and not someone else.

If anything can in principle be justified on the basis God might have some
mysterious ‘good reason’ for it, you might as well claim Jesus Christ married
a goat.

You are again undermining your own argument. Universalism claims that God, by
his nature, could never leave his creatures eternally in hell, and so will in
the end save even all those confined there. You claim this is heresy because
it restricts God’s freedom and limits what God can and cannot do. At the same
time, however, you concede that there are indeed at least some things that God
by his nature cannot do (i.e. sin) and this doesn’t limit his freedom. This is
a contradiction.

Sure. There are a number of more brutal and prolonged ways to kill someone
than even crucifixion. Jesus, for example, being infinitely burned alive would
likewise outweigh the crucifixion. He could also have stayed dead for four
days, or five, or forever. The last is only one of those that would actually
constitute an objectively infinite evil, by the way. A temporary evil
befalling an infinite person does not thereby acquire for itself the status of
infinite.

1) Humans obviously love the Good by natural necessity, as a condition of
willing anything at all. This is where your dualism comes in, as you must
separate God from the Good to make any claims that humans do not do so by
nature.

In his absolute and unconditional love, the God and Father of Jesus Christ has
eternally and immutably determined to bring every human being into the love,
bliss, and ecstatic joy of his Kingdom.

“If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us.”  
It’s not “closely analogous” at all. This is just two different things you
have mashed together. The latter statement has nothing to do with the former
and arguments about it are irrelevant to arguments about universalism.  
Even the former statement is also not actually what universalism states, which
is simply that if God is good then, because he is good, he will save us when
we fall. The only “must” or “cannot” or “necessary” that is involved here is
that God by his very nature is good and so it is impossible that he should not
otherwise than good.

If your orthodoxy, rightly considered, is a cosmic horror story to dwarf
anything Lovecraft could ever have imagined by orders of magnitude, then maybe
your orthodoxy is just a falsehood.

That God’s love counters and extinguishes humans’ death due to sin is pretty
much the whole Gospel.

The confusion lies in where God’s goodness requires that He must save us all.
Either it is merely logically impossible that anyone be saved – that’s clearly
wrong – or it is impossible given something else God did or wanted. If that
thing God did or wanted was merely to create human beings, creating human
beings does not make it that God must elevate them all to supernatural life.
Maybe God could have done something else to bring them into a different sort
of union with Himself. Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the
Fall and mortal sin, that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be
vanquished and defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated
it. But, necessarily, if that evil needed vanquishing, we ipso facto know hell
is possible: that evil was the possibility that we would have been eternally
separated from God without Christ’s atonement. My position is then there are
no a priori reasons from God’s goodness that will show us that hell is
impossible and, given our faith, know a posteriori that hell is possible. We
can then have faith and hope that, since sin has been vanquished, God’s plan
for the future will be good enough even to defeat a possible situation where
some might persist in eternal separation from God through their sins.

If this world contains horrendous evils, e.g., the Holocaust, these are
metaphysically necessary. All worlds God could make involve them all.

I am not certain that I will be saved, but I trust God’s word to me that, if I
hope in Him, He will do so.

I think you need to re-read what I said. I am not presuming that it is
impossible for anyone to prove God could not have a reason to prevent the evil
of damnation, I gave arguments that show it is so. The argument is that
everything which could possibly show that God cannot permit that evil of
eternal damnation would entail heretical conclusions. Either, on the first
fork (God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us), you
get pantheism; or, on the second fork (mortal sin is metaphysically impossible
because humans cannot do otherwise, by nature, than love God supernaturally),
then you arrive at Pelagianism and the denial that the Cross was necessary to
redeem us from the possibility of eternal separation from God. That is why I
said the universalist story on either fork makes nonsense of the Cross and is
incompatible with the orthodox Christian story of the atonement.

” So, I take hell to be identical with any other instance of horrendous evil,
like the Holocaust.”

It’s obviously not metaphysical or ontological necessity since created being
isn’t ontologically necessary. Nothing ‘created’ could be ontologically
necessary. Nevertheless, you seem intent on arguing that for Hart and other
confident universalists, such necessity defines ‘what it is’ that makes it
true that all who are created shall be saved. But this is false.

Fr Rooney: The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be
saved.

That’s a central question of course. But I don’t recall the word “necessarily”
in, say, Hart’s book title. It’s just ‘That All Shall Be Saved’. I don’t think
he or any other universalist would object to bringing ‘necessity’ into the
conversation, provided it’s carefully defined and qualified.

“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Your salvation, you seem to be saying, will be determined not by Christ
clinging to you, but by you clinging to Christ. What a terrifying thought. My
salvation and that of my loved ones is dependent – not on Christ’s death and
resurrection – but on our desperate attempts to maintain our faith in Him.
God’s plan of salvation hinges not on His love, care or lack of abandonment,
but on our decision to accept or reject God – despite our finite, limited and
often deluded perception of who He is. Do you really believe that anyone will
reject God when they see Him in all His glory?

All we could possibly think is that God’s intention to raise humans to grace
before the Fall is what implies that God must do something to repair the Fall
– and I agree! But that’s not an argument for universalism, since it entails
the necessary possibility of eternal separation from God. If God cannot
achieve what greater goods He intends to bring about except by permission of
the possibility of hell in the possibility of the Fall (losing supernatural
grace *happened* and would not have been repaired without the atonement, i.e.,
a state of spiritual death was actual and therefore necessarily possible
someone could persist in it forever metaphysically), we ONLY know strictly
that God intends to achieve a proportionately greater good which will defeat
that spiritual death, at the end of time, through Christ.

The only option as to why God cannot permit damnation is that God could not
possibly intend to bring about a greater good which would be proportionate to
His permission of damnation. And there is no way to prove that what God will
do could not be so great, as it would require access to God’s own knowledge in
order to determine that there is no possible end state of affairs where the
goods involved defeat the evil of an eternal hell. I concluded that the fact
we cannot imagine what that end state would be like is not an objection to its
possibility. [And, as I said in another post this morning, I hope to show in
the future that we can imagine one such possible scenario.]

Does it mean that God heals sinners from their disordered desires and
passions, thereby liberating them for a relationship of friendship and love
with their Creator?

Therefore you should note that the holocaust does not involve man’s highest
good being denied. Eternal hell, on the other hand, does deny man’s highest
good.

When you admit that you are not certain that you will be saved, you are
leaving open the possibility that your eternity will be ultimately tragic. It
is possible that you will experience eternal death. As you wrote, “If it were
not possible for us to end up in eternal death, if Christ did not harrow hell,
Easter is a sham victory, “our preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty” (1 Cor 15:14).”

We’re essentially back where we were in January of 2021 when we all discussed
a good deal of these issues, DBH included:

“God cannot do otherwise because God would not be God without us”  
Nobody is saying this. You are simply either refusing to listen to anything
said to you or out-and-out lying. How is it possible for an apparently
intelligent man dealing honestly to derive this statement from “God would not
do otherwise than save a person who would otherwise eternally suffer because
God is good.”? There is no connection between the two statements. You must
know this, you have been told this repeatedly, and yet just mindlessly repeat
the same lie: why?

The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason for
permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not even
God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission. Nothing
of what you’ve said shows that this is true.

I’d also ask you to imagine that you came across an evil man – perhaps someone
who had killed your entire family – injured on the roadside. I’m sure you know
that it would be your Christian duty to treat him with respect and care, to
nurse him back to heath, to love him, to forgive him – in short to show him
grace. I’d suggest two conclusions we can draw from this are:

Your perseverance is commendable, but there is absolutely no argument that
will alter Rooney’s perspective. He said so.

I think God has offered to save His children in Christ, and that this offer is
a free one. God could have prevented the Fall in the first place. The Fall was
not metaphysically necessary in God’s creation of the world. He only permitted
the Fall to bring about a more glorious set of goods for us. Similarly, if God
permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that this too would be
part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit it because He
intends a triumph in and through that evil.

1) It implies an instrumentalist and utilitarian morality – an ‘ends justify
the means’ approach – which of course is contrary to the Church’s ethical
teachings. The idea that an endless and irredeemable evil could ever be
justified is illogical – because it is literally irredeemable, i.e. nothing
could make it right.

This is, in fact, my position. An eternal hell just is the same as persisting
in mortal sin forever. They are literally identical states of affairs. And now
you should hopefully see my point: Jesus would not have *needed* to save us if
bondage to sin would have ‘ended’ on its own. If Jesus saves us from ‘bondage’
to sin, it is not merely temporary bondage, but spiritual death that *would
have* persisted unless He had come to raise our souls from the dead.

You start the article with the spiritual journey of St. Francis de Sales who,
in your words…

Your forks are both nonsense, God cannot will anything less than the Good and
also humans cannot will anything except the Good as best they perceive it at
any given time. If that makes nonsense of your theory of the atonement all
that shows is your theory of the atonement is gibberish.

_Question_ : What does “cause” mean in “God could not do otherwise than cause
human beings to love him”?

[2] Bonaventure, _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ , chap. 6. On Bonaventure’s
understanding of divinity and necessity, see Zachary Hayes’s “Introduction” to
Bonaventure, _Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity_ (2000), pp.
45-46, 97-100. Hayes writes:

2) He would not be acting towards us as a loving Father would act – which is
contrary to Jesus’ teachings

“So that at the name of Jesus every knee – of beings heavenly and earthly and
subterranean – should bend, And every tongue shall gladly confess that Jesus
the Anointed is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.” Philippians 2: 10,11

There are answers to the questions you ask about what it is that ‘makes it
true’ that none can possibly be irrevocably lost and that all shall finally be
saved.

“I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His
love.”

Either it merely expresses the inability to see a reason according to which
God could be good and permit an eternal hell. I’ve already argued we need no
such reason in order to hope, despite the possibility of hell. And I’ve argued
that hell is necessarily possible, although not necessarily actual. So the
lack of imagination does not give us reason to reject the orthodox teaching
that hell is possible.

Alas, I have been saying this from the first. But the truth is that, as the
“debate” has dragged on, Rooney’s arguments have become both ever more
contradictory and ever more confused. In a sense, he’s doing all the work for
the universalist side. I don’t know why he thinks the arguments he’s making
are good. Maybe just a moral tone-deafness, maybe a sorely deficient capacity
for logical consistency, maybe just desperation to promote a nonsensical and
monstrous theology. Who can say? All I know is that by now I think he’s made
it very clear how very incoherent the tradition he wants to defend truly
is–and how genuinely horrifying in the damage it does to every moral analogy
between God and creation. So keep encouraging him to talk. The longer he goes
on, twisting and turning among incompatible rationalizations, the more he
proves the universalist critique correct.

“Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being contingent
in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise.”

1\. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him, or

Or, the moral argument expresses a heretical claim that God cannot be God
without us, or that our humanity is somehow essentially connected to the goods
of supernatural life, so that humans cannot be human without supernaturally
sharing in God’s own life. Both of these are clearly a kind of heretical claim
because the first is pantheism and the second is Pelagianism or a related
view.

So, to complete the above (in case it was unclear): our human ability to
resist grace and fall away from God consists metaphysically in our contingent
being. Even God cannot create or redeem human beings without humans being
contingent in this way, because it would be a contradiction otherwise. God is
not freer for allowing this possibility, certainly. But God is free to create
beings such as us in the sense that there is no reason He cannot create
contingent and finite things. He does not ‘need’ merely to generate or spirate
the Persons of the Trinity.

But the problem is not ‘higher goods’ per se – the problem is allowing man’s
‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve this ‘higher good’ – because
to do so would be to treat human beings as instruments, as a means to an end.

Here, you seem to be arguing that despite your sinful nature’s resistance to
God’s grace He will deliver you from yourself because God is good. Despite
your best efforts to damn yourself, Christ is your salvation. Period. End of
story.

BUT to hold [1] is Pelagianism or something similar. And [2] cannot be shown
to be true, except on dubious false assumptions about the nature of hell. I
argued we cannot know that God could not be able to bring about greater goods
than damnation through permitting it.

It’s already done. We can argue about whether God needed to do it or not. It
doesn’t matter. He did it. Through the cross Christ made us alive when we were
dead in sin. Past tense…done…by grace we have been saved. God’s love is great,
He is rich in mercy, His goodness far exceeds anything we can imagine. In the
cross, God has saved all. The ending has already been written … and it ends
happily ever after.

You wrote…  
“Hard universalism, in a profound way, misses the point of Christianity. It
misses, as I have already argued, the point of the Cross and what we are saved
from. But, if universalist arguments that supposedly give us “knowledge” that
God will save everyone were true, this would also make trusting God
unnecessary. “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?” (Rom 8:24). Knowledge
that God will save all, on views like “hard universalism,” is just supposed to
be knowledge that things could not have been otherwise.”

Fr. Rooney…the following is what you have argued is at the core of this
debate…

I think that your view of grace and this author’s view of the cross
illustrates a fundamental error in your and his soteriology. God’s grace and
Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.

Does this proposition qualify as a necessary truth? I suppose it must, as
there is no possible world in which God creates human beings where he does not
will to save and deify all. Love is its own necessity.

          * ![](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a8385e40fc2827dafd1c87470970e04?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) David says:

Because it is metaphysically impossible for there to be any “goods” outside of
union with the Good, therefore there is no “greater good” which could ever be
achieved by anything less than that. It’s incredibly obvious.

God’s punishment flows out of His hatred for sin because God hates the
devastating consequences that sin has on His creation. His utter hatred for
sin is an understandable reaction of a God who supremely loves sinners. It
follows therefore that God must not just punish sin, but in the words of
George MacDonald, “He must destroy sin in every man.” A God who only punishes
sin infinitely, without destroying it in His creation is less loving than the
God who does.

I do not think you understand. My argument depends on the claim that the only
limits on God’s omnipotence arose from logical possibility and from His own
intentions. My argument has been that neither of these limits can account for
the truth of your claim that “God, by his nature, could never leave his
creatures eternally in hell.” If God cannot do otherwise than this, something
makes it true. These limits were simply how I derive the three possibilities
that I listed as to what makes universalism true!

“Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction)”

Also remember that there is no higher good for human beings other than loving
God – I’m sure you agree that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
him forever.

The point is that grace and mercy are not mere optional extras for humans and
that we cannot count as ‘good’ – we cannot act in conformity with our nature –
if we chose to reject them.

Try (please try) to imagine God loves us without measure or condition, that
this love sustains our agency (the exercise of which we’re debating) as the
means for our responding to God’s ‘invitation’, that this agency is thus a
‘gift’ possessing its integrity only in its being willingly received “as a
gift” (which precludes it’s be a ‘determined necessity’ – which I take it is
your worry), but which also cannot foreclose upon itself its very nature ‘as
open to God’ at the transcendental level. We don’t bring ourselves into being
ex nihilo and we cannot foreclose upon ourselves at that level, no matter how
fragmented and privated we may be at more superficial levels of consciousness
or habituation.

Or drowned puppies. Or struck men blind. Or – here’s a really absurd one for
you – tortured his children forever!

Of course, the last point lands us back with problematic pantheistic theories
of God’s nature, which seriously problematic assumptions are in the backdrop
of contemporary defenses of universalism. My point, again, is that these
assumptions about God’s nature that are playing a serious background role in
motivating universalism for many here are not as innocent as they seem. They
are profoundly heretical in the sense that they undermine the whole orthodox
Christian story at the roots and substitute a distinct Gospel.

This, I think, is the crux. You do not see any reason that God could have for
allowing that state. But it’s not a logical contradiction with God’s goodness.
It’s not a contradiction with God’s desire to create human beings who are free
that they can do this. Human beings are not such that they would cease to be
human when they persist in mortal sin forever, i.e., exist in hell. There is
nothing in the situation that actually entails a logical contradiction. Hell
is a metaphysical possibility.

Then no you can’t. If a life preserver works one percent of the time and does
nothing as the bearer drowns the other ninety-nine percent, then no you cannot
be confident in it. Even if you reversed those numbers you could still not be
confident in it.

Here you are mistakenly conflating temporal sin with the eternal co-existence
of evil in God’s creation. For more on the difficult issue of temporal
suffering, please have a look at these…

of-evil-2/>

1) this would not mean that this individual ‘deserves’ grace – it’s simply
that the fulfilment of human nature requires conformity to the good, which in
turn requires showing grace in such situations (and the same goes for God)

“God by His nature cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love Him to
the end either [1] because they are human or they act a certain way (e.g.,
love God by natural necessity) or [2] to let any individual fail to love Him
would be to fail to bring about a greater good by permission of sin.”

So what kind of necessary truth is the proposition _God will save all human
beings without exception—_ logically necessary, metaphysically necessary, or
physically necessary? I’m not sure it fits into any of these categories, given
that God is their transcendent Creator. The truth and necessity of the
universalist proposition lies in God himself, who is infinite Being, perfect
Goodness, and absolute Love. I’m happy to stipulate the following:

Once God decides to create human beings, then, thinks Anselm, he is obligated
to his Goodness to become the man Jesus Christ and make atonement for the sins
of the world. God always does his best. To do otherwise would be for God to
deny himself.

This makes no sense. Asserting God will save everyone because God is good is
not the same as saying God will save everyone because we are good, as you must
surely be aware.  
Your second point is basically the same repeated one that you keep making,
which boils down to that God must be capable of evil in order to be good: in
this case saying God must be capable of not being gracious in order for grace
to count as grace. Asserting other people are heretical in the circumstances
is a bit of a cheek, frankly.

On the contrary, universalists clearly assert that Christ’s death and
resurrection is the means by which all are delivered from sin and death. This
hardly makes trusting God unnecessary. Conversely, trusting Christ is the path
everyone will take to be reconciled to God. It is not simply knowledge that
things could not have been otherwise. It is our full assurance of what things
will be – because God is love.

[10] “[For Thomas] the decision to create has nothing directly to do with the
divine goodness, since it is an arbitrary and radically free act of the divine
will.” Kevin Keane, “[Why Creation? Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas on God as
Creative Good](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/bonvaventure-and-

2) No genuine father could ever love something more than he loved his own
children. But Jesus teaches us that God *is* our Father. If you think there is
a *higher end* that God loves more than the good of his own children, then you
must deny that God is our Father.

Yes it is. To establish an evil which last forever is in fact the exact
opposite of goodness and therefore constitutes a logical contradiction to the
claim of goodness.

The problem with the first option is that God would not be God. God would not
be the origin of all being and goodness, but a dependent thing; or, you think
the universe is akin to a fourth person of the Trinity (distinct in hypostasis
but not in nature); or, you think the universe is essential to the eternal
procession of the Son. All of these are bad, serious, and should be entirely
rejected. The reason is that all the options are heretical accounts of the
divine nature, by everyone’s lights Orthodox, Catholic, and mainline
Protestant, and that each these accounts is a kind of nonsense (i.e., saying
God is essentially related to the universe is going to lead you into the
equivalent of affirming the existence of a ‘shapeless square’).

” If God must save us if He creates us, this is very closely analogous to the
situation where God must create us, because otherwise He would not be God
without us. ”

The difference here is that hell is an endless evil, whereas the holocaust –
evil as it was – did not last forever and therefore in principle can be
redeemed.

The question is what makes it true that all will necessarily be saved. You
need to identify what that is clearly before you figure out what my response
is to your position, since I responded to the three possible ways universalism
can be true.

2\. is like 1. But grant we need grace to live a life of charity, it’s not by
nature, and that God allows us to resist grace insofar as we can damage our
relationship to Him but not lose charity. Here the implication is that
original sin did not lose charity.  
If original sin did not lose grace for human beings (since one can only have
charity in a state of grace), then baptism and sacraments are not necessary
means for restoring humans to grace, as applying His sacrifice to us. Christ’s
sacrifice only left us a good example. Pelagius!

What did original sin do? According to orthodox Christianity, it was an actual
mortal sin. Original sin earned eternal spiritual death. Death of the body is
an image of that. But universalists have to reject this, since they reject
that anyone merits eternal spiritual death.

2) just because humans – in order to conform to their nature – must show
grace, it does not mean this grace is not given freely (consider the fact that
Jesus could hardly have decided not to show grace and mercy during his earthly
ministry and somehow still count as ‘good’ – to reject grace is to reject God)

Rogers’ point about options is crucial yet easily overlooked. As soon as the
question of divine freedom is raised, we immediately slip into ontic divinity
mode. We think of God as a being among beings who must everyday navigate a
multitude of choices. And of course his first choice was to decide whether to
create or not create a finite universe. And then he had to decide what kind of
beings he wants to populate within it. And so on and so forth . . . a grand
cosmos-building sim game. But what if God is not a being but transcendent
actuality? What if God does not choose between alternatives, but is the doer
and doing, the savior and saving of creation? God is his act of existence
_—ipsum esse_ _subsistens_.8  Or perhaps even better: _Deus suus actus amandi
est_.

Study those Philippians verses again. Do you think that God the Father would
be glorified by mankind’s continued and eternal rejection of His Son?

Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.

This position of mine does not require thinking God would act immorally,
contrary to our moral intuitions, but that we just cannot *see* how it is that
God is acting well according to all of those intuitions. So, I take hell to be
identical with any other instance of horrendous evil, like the Holocaust. I
see that evil and have no way of explaining why it is that God allowed it. I
even think it would likely be problematic to try to do so. But I do not doubt
that God has such a good reason to permit it.

What in my claims required this to be the case? I think it is fairly obvious
that God is quite different from demons on the basis of being the Good itself.
I do not deny that we can know God is good, but that we cannot know whether He
has a good reason (that is, a reason in harmony with that goodness) for any
given instance of evil and suffering, which would permit Him to allow that
evil in light of His good purposes.

Rogers acknowledges that Anselm does not explicitly affirm the inevitability
of divine creation—it wasn’t a burning question at the time he lived—but
Anselm had no qualms about affirming the necessity of the Incarnation:

Likewise, God necessarily creates – in the sense, if there there is a
‘nothing’ (other than God), God will necessarily fill it with a ‘something’
(i.e. create) – but that does not make God dependent on that something, on
creation.

So, in other words, I do not find a mere inability to conceive of a possible
reason God could have any compelling reason to embrace universalism. It might
be possible God allows hell, it might not. The Christian orthodox tradition
disclaims knowledge of what God’s ultimate goal might be, only affirming that
it is possible for people to go to hell forever. I’ve argued that the
possibility is a necessary component of Christianity. Otherwise, grace is not
grace. That’s the serious deep issue at the heart of this discussion.

God’s permitting temporary evils do not fall foul of this objection, so long
as this permission is ultimately aimed at achieving man’s ‘chief end’ – in
which case God would (by definition) be treating us as an end in itself.
Whereas if God allowed man’s ‘chief end’ to be frustrated in order to achieve
some other end, this would very obviously be to treat us as a means, not an
end.

For me, the Moral Argument secures the impossibility of ECT as a ‘possible
outcome’ of any world an infinitely loving God would create. Even if one were
to understand God’s determination to create in full libertarian mode (and I
know many who see it this way – some universalists and others not) it wouldn’t
matter; i.e., it wouldn’t make infernalism possibly true (for all the reasons
Hart’s Moral Argument describes). There is no morally intelligible ‘final end’
to God’s creative act that includes the final loss of any of us (regardless of
the degree to which one believes 2ndary agency to obtain).

In his article Rooney takes David Bentley Hart to task for teaching that God’s
creation of the world is necessary. Divine freedom necessarily entails the
ability to choose between creating or not creating the world. Rooney’s
understanding is dependent upon St Thomas Aquinas, among others. Philosopher
Katherin Rogers advances an interpretation of St Anselm that challenges
Rooney’s Thomistic construal of divine freedom. Like all medieval
philosophers, she tells us, Anselm affirms that God’s creation of the world is
free and voluntary. He does not need to create in order to fill an ontological
lack or defect. How­ever, she goes on to say, Anselm’s understanding of the
divine goodness—God always does the best—logically leads to the conclusion the
creation of the world was in fact inevitable:

I think you are confusing the issue by failing to take into account what is
true of God intrinsically and what is true by extrinsic denomination.

So, you basically have Ivan Karamazov’s view of God, but it doesn’t bother
you.

Nothing can outweigh an infinite evil for the precise reason that it is
infinite and therefore can never be anything but infinitely, objectively bad.

“Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very act of children.”

Put aside all the concerns about freedom, because they’re a distraction from
what we’re discussing here.

Also, I think it’s important to see that universalism is really problematic on
many different levels in terms of other heretical beliefs it entails. I’ve
only mentioned some of the more prominent. But since the folks here always
inevitably get up on bickering about free will, you might consider that, if
universalism were true, Pelagianism would also be true.

In all such cases, the being necessarily acts according to its nature; it is
not free to do otherwise. Human beings may also be described as acting
according to nature if their disordered desires and addictions inhibit their
willing according to the sound dictates of reason.

I am perfectly happy to say we can be confident in God’s love to save us. We
cannot be confident, however, that God does not allow some to reject His love.
Even if we are not confident that God *actually* allows anyone to resist His
love, we can both know that hell is possible (there is no contradiction) and
that, if hell were actual, we would thereby know that God intends to achieve
something good for everyone by means of allowing some to resist His love
forever. I might not see that reason here or be able to imagine it, but I
should trust that God would have such a reason, just as I might be scandalized
by God’s permission of great and atrocious evils like the Holocaust but, since
they have occurred, I know God must have some good reason for permitting them
which, when we see Him face-to-face, will not leave us in despair.

I know that some are wondering why I have spent so much blog time featuring
discussion of Fr James Dominic Rooney’s article “[The Incoherences of Hard
Universalism](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/)” and why I have now written yet another piece on it. I
wonder about that myself. I think I have done so mainly because I am intrigued
and challenged by his statement that “universalists hold that it is a
_necessary_ truth that all are saved,” with the clear implication that if it’s
a necessary truth, then the greater hope is grounded in a deterministic
metaphysics. Even God’s freedom, so Rooney argues, is fatally compromised by
the universalist doctrine. As a lowly parish priest (retired!), I am not well-
versed in the ins and outs of necessary truths. So I grabbed my virtual copy
of _The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ and found this explanation:

3\. says God has no reason to permit anyone to persist in a state such a that,
without His help, you would remain in mortal sin. (Pelagius claimed it would
be unjust to permit anyone to be punished for the actions of others. Expand
that to include those of my past self!) On 3, it seems God’s grace is not
freely given. God’s decisions to give grace would be a necessary consequence
of God’s nature and His decision to create human beings. But, if so, grace
does not appear to be grace anymore; it is something we merit by nature.

You are, by any measure, simply lying. Does this not bother you at all?

If you feed and care for a dog, it will love you. If it doesn’t, there’s
something terribly wrong with you.

[8] I confess I find it virtually impossible to contemplate God in his
transcendence and even more so to articulate. How do we think Deity beyond
being and his decision to create the cosmos? And of course we can’t.
Inevitably we think of him as a being confronted by a variety of choices.
Reading Dionysius the Areopagite several years ago, with Eric Perl as my
guide, was a real eye-opener for me. See, e.g., my article “[Transcending
Freedom and Necessity](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/dionysian-
ponderings-transcending-freedom-and-necessity/).” Until one has glimpsed the
radical difference between Creator and creature, statements like the following
will make little sense:

A certain want of coherence has been noticeable all along, don’t you think?

“God’s grace and Jesus’ mission on earth did not save us from an eternal hell.
Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin.”

Both Thomas and Anselm affirm that God is free in his act of creation. For
Thomas, though, this means God was equally indifferent to the three options
before him—to create this world, to create a different world, or not to create
any world at all. For this reason God’s creation of the world must be seen as
an eruption of pure voluntarist will and therefore arbitrary. No decisive
reason can be offered.10 But Anselm comes at the matter from a different
starting point:

God always acts in Love and Goodness, in every possible world.  
God always wills the good; he always does the best.  
And the best, the very, very best, is apokatastasis.

Similarly, I’ve heard clergymen argue that without an eternal hell, God would
never have sent His Son to endure the agony of the cross. One author I’ve
recently read put it this way… “It is the greatest defence of hell, for surely
if there is not an eternal hell of the greatest possible torments, God would
not have sent His Son to endure such agony. Without hell there would be no
need for the cross. Given the historical fact of Christ’s crucifixion, God
would be a moral monster if there were not an eternal hell to demand such
penal suffering. If there is no hell, either Jesus is not God’s son or God is
not good.”

“Similarly, what we know is that, when God permitted the Fall and mortal sin,
that He intended to repair it so that its evil would be vanquished and
defeated. We now know, through faith, that Christ has defeated it.”  
But that is universalism! It is  
your case that God did not intend to repair it and that its evil won’t be
vanquished and defeated, and Christ has not defeated it, but rather that God
may either permit or be unable to prevent some proportion of its evil to
remain, so that some may remain unsaved and condemned to hell for eternity.  
You keep making the same point over and over again despite being told by many,
many people that this has nothing to do with universalism. Universalism does
not deny hell, nor the possibility (indeed certainty) that *without the
intervention of God through Christ* we’d all end up eternally confined there.
What universalism insists on is that God, because of the nature of God and who
and what God is, will necessarily and inevitably “repair it so that its evil
would be vanquished and defeated” and ultimately destroy hell and save all in
hell from being eternally confined within it.

So you see, it’s a not a problem of ‘imagination’ – it’s a problem of logic.
It is not logically consistent to hold that 1) humans’ chief end is to love
God; 2) God loves humans unconditionally as their Father; and 3) God permits
humans’ chief end to be denied because God values certain goods more than he
values the good of human beings.

By the logic that inevitability and necessity are the same, for God to be
free, God must be capable of sin, and could have chosen to sin, and just
happened not to. To say otherwise is apparently heretical as imposing a
necessity on God. Even if one arbitrarily carves out a necessity not to sin as
somehow different, it doesn’t really help. Imperfection in love is a sin, and
the whole point of universalism is that abandoning people unnecessarily for
eternity in hell is an imperfection in love, which is why we can be 100%
confident God won’t do it.

I understand you to be saying that if the possibility of a place of eternal
conscious torment doesn’t exist then grace would be diluted because the death
sentence that God commutes is less hideous.

DBH: “ The claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot
truly be free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good.”

If it is the case that God can do otherwise than He does, that does not imply
that He can sin; it means, for example, that He could not have created the
universe, but also that could have created a better one than this, etc.

The ‘making true’ of this inevitability is not a terminus ad quem, not a sand
in the line, a point at which God steps in and ‘gets it done’. It’s an
aesthetic inevitability, James; the inevitability of enchantment and
seduction. God rescues and saves us erotically. It can’t be possible that the
surrender of the beloved to the divine lover is just a calculated machination
of necessity.

But given that the majority of Eastern theologians affirm everlasting
perdition, this difference between the traditions would appear to be
irrelevant for the present discussion. But perhaps not completely irrelevant.
Orthodox universalists like myself believe that God’s eternal determination to
reconcile and deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to
create rational beings in the image of his incarnate Son.

However you posit that there is some ‘higher good’ which God desires *more*
than his children loving him, i.e. you think it is acceptable for God to allow
man’s chief end to be denied, because he has some even more important ‘end’ in
sight.

“…of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the divine life.”

Does it mean that God providentially places sinners in situations, perhaps
acutely uncomfortable and painful, where conversion becomes compelling, even
existentially necessary? St Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ would be an
example of such divine causation.

Does it mean that God unilaterally changes the wills of obdurate sinners,
something along the lines of an involuntary lobotomy? All universalists would
reject this form of causal invasion.

When Fr Rooney was going on about freedom, universalists were guilty of
determinism. Now we’re Pelagians!

The mere incapacity to imagine why God might allow some to be separated from
Him eternally does not give us good reason to believe it is not possible,
however. And we do not need any reason to say that we should trust that
whatever God might do is good, even if He were to allow hell:

christian-hope/>

Combine that with their proud ignorance of the Christian tradition as a whole
and you may see why, after decades of dealing with them, I have decided always
to treat them with the asperity they deserve. You can’t hold a debate with
what is, in the end, a tragic psychosis. As it’s self-induced, however, it’s
also hard to pity it too earnestly.

I’m no trained philosopher or theologian. I’m trying to learn how to go from
treading to swimming in deep waters that I’ve found myself thrown into by
virtue of having been born, and part of that is trying to listen to others,
and think through these matters for myself, matters which have always seemed
vitally important to me. Having said that, I will add my two cents by saying
that I think the issue that divides Fr. Rooney from the Fr. Kimel and most of
the commenters here (including me) is a matter moral imagination. I, for one,
can imagine a Creator God choosing between different goods in the act of
creation, as I assume there are many different kinds of good that God could
choose to realize in the act of creating. But I cannot imagine a good God
choosing a creation in which any of his creatures would wind up in a state of
eternal, tormented separation from him. I don’t imagine this as a choice
between real goods, but rather as an illusory choice that might be made by a
Gnostic Demiurge, thinking, in its ignorance and self-delusion, that it is the
Creator, and that its twisted act of imitation is authentic Divine creation. A
god playing God, and getting it all wrong — that’s the only kind of god I can
imagine choosing to allow such a fate for beings it thinks it has created.
Fortunately, that god is not our Creator, and lacks the power to realize such
a perverse choice.

Moreover, it is a lie under the absolute predestination which you admit to
believing in to say God “permits” anything. Say what you mean plainly and stop
attempting to obfuscate it.

If I understand this correctly (“…God’s eternal determination to reconcile and
deify all sinners is intrinsic to God’s eternal decision to create rational
beings in the image of his incarnate Son”), what you need to respond to is
either the criticisms of my first or last options in the dilemma.

_Initial observation_ : the phrase “could not do otherwise” suggests that
Rooney is attribut­ing libertarian freedom of choice to God. To be free God
must enjoy the liberty to save or not save sinners in every possible world he
might create, just as he must enjoy the same liberty to become or not become
incarnate in every world he might create. If God lacks this freedom, then his
salvific will is _necessitated_ and _determined_. As Rooney likes to put it,
“Necessitation is not Freedom” (NINF). As we shall see, however, the
attribution of libertarian choice to the transcendent Creator is by no means
uncontroversial and cannot be said to enjoy philosophical and theological
consensus.

Also, your definition of “freedom” is wildly incoherent notion driven by
absolutely nothing but a will to believe in an eternal hell for the sake of
believing it. You switch between libertarian and compatibilist positions
freely depending on whether you are calling universalists determinists or
Pelagians this week. You believe in an absolute predestination and then have
the gall to say “freedom” as a reason for believing in an eternity of torment.

If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so. The
only way it would be impossible for anyone to go to hell is,

Father, consider that the sun necessarily heats the earth – in the sense that,
if there is an earth, the sun will heat it – but that does not make the sun
dependent on the earth.

Let me stop you right there: you’ve misunderstood all that I have said.

“The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument.”

Being able to do otherwise does not require being able to sin. Conversely,
being unable to do otherwise, simply speaking, is not the same as being unable
to sin. We are talking about different things.

And respectfully, I’ll ask you again Fr. Rooney.  
How certain are you, that you will be saved and why?  
I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

You have not addressed point 2 at all. As for point 1, you point out that
universalists might sometimes appeal to ‘higher goods’ – and that therefore
for all we know there is some higher good that would justify hell.

Jesus did not come to deliver us from punishment or the consequences of our
sin. He came to deliver us from bondage to sin.  
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us
alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you
have been saved.” Ephesians 2:4-5

Does it mean something along the lines of the Augustinian and Thomist
construals of infallible or efficacious grace, whereby God “causes” sinners to
freely repent of their sins and turn to him in faith? In that case, Rooney
finds himself opposing not just universalists but a longstanding Latin
tradition.

If you genuinely think that ‘grace’ is something extrinsic to God’s nature –
something optional which he so happens to choose but could have done otherwise
– then you deny the incarnation is a genuine revelation, which of course is to
deny the incarnation full stop.

Father, regarding your worry in option 3 – that grace would not be “freely
given” if it necessarily followed from God’s nature – seems to depend upon a
libertarian and voluntarist construal of divine freedom that is highly
contestable. Consider that the fact God – having made a promise to Abraham –
will necessarily keep it does not mean that God does not freely keep his
promise.

In love he became Man in Jesus Christ.  
In love he died on the cross for the sins of the world.  
In love he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.  
In love he poured out the Spirit on all flesh.  
In love he will return in glory to judge the quick and the dead.  
In love he will restore all of creation to himself.  
In love he will be all in all.

You seem to be the one who is dreadfully confused. And, for that matter,
something of a dualist who won’t admit to it.

I said that it is impossible, though admittedly I was working under the
premise that God is the Good and therefore can will nothing but the Good for
anything or anyone, which Fr. Rooney seems to have some sort of problem with.
He appears to believe that the two are somehow separate, but only when
convenient for whatever his notion of “freedom” is today.

This is false and it is totally improper for you to say this.

The first option seems to me much more serious, and I think it’s the way you,
DBH, and Jordan Wood go. This is that you think God makes an eternal decision
such that God cannot have done otherwise than create and save human beings,
because God being the Good requires that He always act this way. This simply
makes God dependent on the universe, implying a form of pantheism, because God
has an essential relation to the universe. This is obviously true if you
accept that account of modality implied by possible world semantics, since you
said that God necessarily does exactly the same thing in every universe – on
that possible world semantics, this entails that God is essentially related to
the universe. Now, you can give another account of essence, but you seem to
think that God’s essence involves necessarily creating and redeeming. If this
is essential to God, you have a deep problem in your account of the divine
nature.

“Thus, my argument is simply that God, by His nature, needs to do none of what
you claim He must do.”  
With respect, that’s not the argument you originally made. Your argument was
that it was heresy to suggest that God by his nature necessarily did anything
or avoided doing anything at all. Without that argument (which you now retreat
from) it is down to what in fact it is or is not in God’s nature to do.  
You assert that it is within God’s nature to deliberately abandon or
potentially abandon at least some people to eternal conscious torment;
universalists assert that it is not. To say that it is within God’s nature to
do so is to run contrary to declaration after declaration in the Bible that it
isn’t. Your only justification for this is that there might be some completely
unknowable good that comes from it. I really don’t understand what good you
think that could be. It cannot be a good for God, since, by your own argument
which we all agree on, God has nothing that for himself he needs or wants. It
cannot be for the sinners in hell themselves, since that would mean they would
be better off unsaved than saved, which is absurd. The only persons,
therefore, that it could be a good for is the saved, which means that they
would be being saved, or somehow achieving greater bliss, at the expense of
the deliberate sacrifice and eternal torment of the damned. Is that what you
really believe? If so, then your belief is as bad as the “abominable fancy”,
the idea that the saved are entertained and increased in bliss by observing
the torments of the damned, and, which is worse, you would believe that God
saves us not through sending us Christ who voluntarily sacrificed himself and
descended to hell to save us from it, but through the involuntary sacrificing
of sinners to eternal torment.

No. This is absolute nonsense. The truth is the opposite: even God cannot
create human beings or anything else that has any final destination or
ultimate desire beyond himself. He couldn’t do so even if he wanted to (which
of course he couldn’t) because there simply is nothing else.

Then, you seamlessly revert to an argument for hard universalism. You wrote…  
“In trust, I know that I might possibly resist God’s grace, but I know that
God is also Good and that He cares for me—Christ, then, is my fortress and
bulwark against myself.”

That leaves them needing to find other options: there are precisely three.
Either original sin does not involve spiritual death because  
1\. sin is by nature impossible.  
2\. only venial sin is possible.  
3\. mortal sin is possible and maybe actual but God has no reason to permit a
state such that, if God does not help, you would remain in it forever.

The “greater good” defense of eternal damnation is without doubt the worst
possible argument. The same logic is employed by Calvinist double
predestinarians and Augustinian-Thomist preteritionists. It can be used to
justify any evil. Ultimately, it is nothing more than might makes right. It
has no place in Christian discourse.

What? The incapacity to imagine why God might “allow” (really: cause) some to
be tormented for all eternity gives us excellent reason to suppose it is not
possible, simply because moral reason makes it quite obvious that there is
none that could ever be a metaphysical possibility. As morality exists
logically prior to any claims of revelation, any such claims of which such
cruel absurdity are necessary components can only be false revelations.

Free action, on the other hand, always involves three elements: knowledge,
volition, consent and approval. And so it is with God: he knows what he wants;
he wills and approves what he does. He is the absolute and final source of all
his decisions. His _ad extra_ actions are intrinsically voluntary, self-
determined, non-necessitated— _even if he always does what he does in every
possible world_. Nothing can compel him to will and act; nothing can inhibit
him from expressing his nature and achieving his ends. He is incomparably free
in his divine aseity and omnipotence. God, we might say, is the ultimate
source incompatibilist. He is totally responsible for his actions. Divine
freedom does not logically entail the ability to do otherwise and therefore
does not require libertarian free choice.6

The point is that we know what *our* highest good is – to love God – and if
God chose to allow the frustration of our highest good in order to achieve
some supposedly ‘higher good’ – then he would not be acting towards us as a
loving father, and he would be treating us as a means, not end.

Now, here is the key phrase “he knows that nothing God will ever let happen to
him will be ultimately tragic or hopeless.” You end the article in a similar
vein “When we have hope, we already expect that God’s goodness will shatter
even the limits of our imagination, and that, even when things appear to be
hopeless, they never are.”

I would love the opportunity for a follow up – based on your answer.

The necessity of human death is counterbalanced by the necessity of God’s
love. Could It be?

Unless you rely on the claim that, in some hitherto unknown and unknowable
way, evil can be good. Oh, I’m sorry, “permitting evil.”

Jesus, in fact, came to save us from sin. As the angel told Joseph…  
“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because
he will save his people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

So why does the universalist disagree with Rooney’s claim that universal
salvation implies the heretical necessitation of God’s salvific will? Perhaps
it’s just the word _necessitation_ , which seems to imply that God is
compelled to save against his desire and will. Rooney, I’m sure, does not
intend that anthropomorphic connotation, yet it’s difficult to avoid. We need
to be clear: In and because of his aseity, all of God’s _ad extra_ actions are
performed in utter freedom. Nothing external or internal forces him to act.
But perhaps Rooney has in mind what philosophers call natural necessity: an
agent performs an action by _natural_ necessity when its nature functions as
the principle of its action.5 Natural necessity typically obtains when the
agent is inanimate or nonrational.

I would point out that appeal to greater goods – namely, that of final union
of all with God – is precisely what universalists appeal to in order to
justify evils as well. So it would be inconsistent for universalists to reject
appeal to greater goods in principle. If the sufferings of this life were not
permitted on account of the goods involved in that final union, that make such
sufferings negligible, then God would be pretty bad (I take it) to allow all
the suffering along the way.

You are right that God makes a promise to Abraham and that THIS act is what
establishes God’s promise. The creation of the universe and human beings does
not establish that later promise. God’s later promise and covenant with
Abraham is His response to the Fall, not to the creation.

You have have been asked to prove that which he had already concluded is
“necessarily impossible” to prove.

Thus, Fr Rooney is not interested in genuine debate and never was, which is
why you are not getting it from him. That became obvious very early on.

Fr Rooney: “My argument is simply that universalists have not shown that it is
impossible for God to permit people to reject His love forever – and that
proving this is *necessarily* impossible. There is no way to do so.”

This is the very thesis of universalism. This is really just a repetition of
Thomas Talbott’s conviction that an omnipotent God will never let his creation
suffer irreparable harm.

Making sense then of the psychology by which human agency maintains its
integrity (without collapsing into any kind of unilateral determination of its
exercise in all the objectionable ways Orthodox, including Hart, maintain) in
coming round to see God as its highest good and surrendering itself to the,
shall we say, ‘enchantment’ of divine love and beauty is a separate matter.
But what’s important is that when it comes to this or that necessity, it’s as
important to ask what makes it necessarily the case that ECT is an impossible
final end to creation.

You wrote…  
“If we were to discover that God made it possible for us to resist his grace
forever, then, I would think, we come to know that, if he did so, he did this
for a good reason that was an expression of his love and mercy for us. I would
be more confident of that than of any argument to the contrary, even if I were
unable to imagine any possible reason that God had for doing so, because I
think it is good to trust God.”

Perhaps I am thinking about this too simplistically, but if we posit that God
desires all to be saved, how can God be “freer” if there is a possibility that
all ultimately are not saved? In other words, the point is not that God
necessarily must save everyone, but rather that because God is free and not
subject to any external necessity we can be confident He will accomplish His
desire to save everyone. Of course, if we don’t posit that God desires all to
be saved the point doesn’t hold, but then that is the issue, not any concern
about necessity.

Firstly, God cannot be good without willing the fullness of the Good for all
things, and hence there can be no scenario in which he introduces that which
fails to attain to it as it would be impossible to motivate him to create
such, even setting aside the blatantly insane arguments that one could ever
choose anything else given full comprehension.

“The second option is that you think God can have no good justifying reason
for permitting anyone to persist in mortal sin forever, in the sense that not
even God could achieve suitable greater goods by virtue of this permission.
Nothing of what you’ve said shows that this is true.”

Before I suggest one hard universalist’s suggestion of what it is that make it
true that all shall be saved, let me suggest that there are some other equally
crucial questions to ask. One is: What makes it true that none can freely and
irrevocably foreclose upon all possibility of Godward movement? It’s fair to
ask what makes other views possible or impossible as well. In my own journey,
I became certain that ECT (and annihilation for the same reason) was an
impossible eschatology before I came to bring this to bear upon the question
of what it was that the brought it about that all shall bow the knee to
Christ. But once the possibility of ECT’s being true disappeared, final
universal reconciliation became the only possible ‘final end’ to humanity’s
journey from origin to end.

Man’s chief end is to love God. If God acts in a way that allowed this chief
end to be frustrated and subordinated to some ‘higher good’, this would mean:

Yes there is, it is manifest and obvious. Hell is an eternal and everlasting
evil and therefore cannot be product of nor can it in any way be a necessary
ingredient in any kind of good. Therefore, if God is good, it is impossible
that he should create any everlasting evil, let alone any creature which would
suffer it.

I don’t feel that I’m being any harsher than DBH, but it’s your blog so ok.

Fr. Rooney thanks for taking the time to reply. I was pleased to read that you

after reading your linked article

_The Saint Anselm Journal_ 1.1 (Fall 2003): 3-4; emphasis mine.

As a Latin theologian, Rooney is heir to the Augustinian-Thomist tradition
that after humanity’s fall into sin and alienation, God remains free to decide
whether or not to exercise his salvific will. Humanity does not deserve
rescue, only judgment and dam­nation. If God should subsequently decide to
save, it’s pure grace, contingent not necessary. Eastern theologians, however,
following St Maximus the Confessor, insist otherwise.4 God’s free decision to
create includes his decision to save fallen humanity in Jesus Christ.
Incarnation logically precedes creation. If humanity had not sinned, the
eternal Son would still have embodied himself as a human being in order to
divinize all; but given the Adamic Fall, the incarnate Son freely but
necessarily embraces his soterio­logical mission of cross and resurrection,
not as a second decision but as a decision made in God’s one eternal act. From
the beginning, it’s all grace. In the words of the Apostle Paul:

We also agree that Jesus saves us from an eternity of spiritual death. So far,
so good. However, after reading your church life journal post I am convinced
even more, that your arguments against a “hard universalism” are untenable and
somewhat contradictory.

As to the second, of course a human cannot be a human without sharing in the
divine life. Really, what do you think the human telos is? Or the telos of
anything, for that matter? Have you forgotten your basic metaphysics? Nothing
exists except insofar as it shares in the Good.

with Jared Goff.

Posted on [30 November
2022](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/universal-salvation-love-is-
its-own-necessity/ "4:01 pm") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr

– that a God of infinite and unconditional love could not (not just would not)
create a world of sentient creatures whose end could ‘possibly’ be anything
other than final union with God.  
– that spiritual creatures (however free) cannot irrevocably foreclose upon
themselves all possibility of Godward movement, for the possibility to move
Godward always precedes any movement of the created will as its very ground.  
– Given the metaphysics of created being grounded in the Good, in
unconditional and infinite love, as its most inward reality, there can be no
finite perspective on reality so privated as to foreclose upon itself all
possibility of Godward becoming.

Not also that he keeps getting the argument wrong. No one has said that it is
impossible for God to permit creatures to resist his love forever. The
claim–the logically irrefutable claim–is that such rejection cannot truly be
free, and so the God who permits it cannot possibly be good. But he still has
failed to demonstrate an understanding of TASBS–which is what set this endless
debate in motion–so it’s not surprising that he still doesn’t get it.

Yes, all that Rooney has demonstrated is that he is utterly confused as to
what constitutes goodness. I wish him all the best with that.

God loves the cosmos into being.  
He loves every human being into existence.  
He loves and will love each unto deification and glory.

“The creation of the universe and human beings does not establish that later
promise.”

Later in your article you insist that if evil persists eternally, then God
must have an acceptable rationale. You wrote …  
“So, if evil occurs, we can be confident that God has good reasons for
permitting it. This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it
formalizes the “hopeful” reasoning by which Christians respond to evils in
their life.”

1\. straight forwardly would undermine the Christian claims about Adam and Eve
sinning. Put those aside. If 1 allows there is free action toward the good, 1.
then could imply that we can by nature do good deeds, without God’s special
grace. This is Pelagianism exactly.

The next question I ask myself is “am I better than God?”. It seems pretty
obvious to me that I am not and therefore that – if showing grace and mercy is
an essential constituent of perfect human goodness – then we cannot hold God
to a lower standard than we do ourselves.

Justifying evil by suggesting we simply lack the imagination to see the
mysterious “good reason” behind it is absurd and dangerous.

On the basis of what you say, it seems to me that any picture/description of
divinity could be justified, however morally repugnant, and anything such a
god did or does could be morally justified. In short, it would be impossible
to determine the difference between God and demons, or between the God and
Father of Jesus Christ from the god of the Aztec priests offering human
sacrifices. It would also be impossible to use morality to determine whether
what is said of such a god’s character and actions would disqualify them from
consideration in identifying the true God. Furthermore, any action, however
morally repulsive, could be justified on the part of devotees to such a god,
and there would be no moral guideline to adjudicate the claims or actions
either of such pretenders to Godhood, or their followers, because nothing is
more morally repulsive than letting/making (the distinction is without
difference) sentient beings exist forever in a state of eternal, conscious
torment.

2) Given that the damnation of even a single individual would be an infinite
evil, it is not mathematically possible for there to be any good greater than
it. Therefore basic logic informs us that no such reason could exist.

1) He would be treating us as a means, not an end – because he would be
subordinating our good to some higher good – which is contrary to the Church’s
ethical teachings.

“Similarly, if God permits some to fall away and end up in hell forever, that
this too would be part of His good plan for us, and that He would only permit
it because He intends a triumph in and through that evil.”

That is not right. If God makes a promise to Abraham, while he is in a sense
able not to keep that promise, it would be incompatible with his goodness (and
his true freedom) not do so. Same for saving us – it’s an implicit in the very
act of children. To think otherwise just makes God a dead-beat dad.

“…any picture/description of divinity could be justified, however morally
repugnant, and anything such a god did or does could be morally justified.”

So why does the universalist believe that God freely, necessarily, and
efficaciously wills the salvation of all? The answer is simple: because God is
Love.

What we would need to ask is whether that situation He aims to bring about at
the end of time would, in fact, be a proportionate good that would defeat even
the badness involved in hell’s existence, or whether it could not possibly
involve an eternal hell. And we cannot prove that there is NO possible state
at the end times that would defeat the badness of hell. The fact someone
cannot imagine what that end state might look like is no objection to its
possibility. [But I think we can also give an account of the way in which that
might be possible, which I hope to share with you all in a future article.]

It really is mind boggling. I always thought you were exaggerating when you
talked about how pointlessly infuriating Catholic fundamentalists (Thomists or
otherwise) are.

In other words, _aiōnion_ by itself does not necessarily imply endlessness yet
the over­whelming number of English translations render the word “eternal” or

attributed to St Basil of Caesarea in the fourth century:

"To see the good truly is to desire it insatiably; not to desire it is not to
have known it, and so never to have been free to choose it." ~ David Bentley
Hart

But what about hell? This is the question we all want answered. Did not Jesus
and his Apostles explicitly warn us of the dire consequences of disbelief and
impenitence? Did they not plainly teach that those who reject the divine offer
of mercy will suffer eternal punish­ment? Universalists must provide plausible
readings of the key New Testament texts that speak of Gehenna if they ever
hope to persuade their fellow Christians that the omnipotent love of God will
triumph in the hearts of every human being. The Parable of the Last Judgment
immediately comes to mind as a test case.

God: The Aiónion Punishment of Gehenna").

The difference between Talbott and Ramelli–Konstan is minor, however. The
former interprets _kolasin aiōnion_ to mean “the punishment that comes from
God”; the latter, “the punishment that belongs to the age to come.” Both call
in question the interpretation that the phrase signifies unending retributive
torment. Talbott, in fact, expresses his agreement with the reading of
_aiōnion_ as “belonging to the age to come” as a complement to his own:

> In the New Testament, then, _ἀΐδιος_ , which is used far less often than

Nonetheless, Jesus did say that the wicked will be condemned to “eternal
punishment” ( _kolasin aiōnion_ ) and the righteous rewarded with “eternal
life” ( _zōēn aiōnion_ ). “Why suppose,” queries Talbott, “that on either
occasion of its use in Matthew 25:46 the Greek adjective _aiōnios_ , which
many of our English Bibles translate as ‘eternal’ or ‘everlasting,’ implies
_unending temporal duration_?”

What is the didactic point of the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats? Did
Jesus really intend to convey to his hearers divinely revealed information
about the eschatological destinies of the righteous and wicked? Even a cursory
reading of the parable compels a negative answer. As Thomas Talbott observes,
the heart of the parable is its surprising twist—the solidaric identification
of the Son of Man with the poor and dispossessed. Like all of Jesus’ parables,
its purpose is not to provide details about the afterlife but to elicit a
conversion of heart and behavior.

If eonian life is eternal and unending, then, so the argument goes, eonian
punishment must also be eternal and unending—and vice versa. The parallelism
is determinative. Talbott, however, does not find this argument compelling. It
forgets how adjectives work. “Adjec­tives,” he explains, “often vary in
meaning, sometimes greatly, when the nouns they qualify signify different
categories of things”3—and there can be no question that eonian life and
eonian punishment belong to two different categories of things. We rightly
believe that eonian life is everlasting because it is life in and with the
eternal God; but we cannot assume that the same everlastingness is to be
attributed to the eonian punishment. A tip-off here is our Lord’s use of
_kolasis_ , which typically signifies remedial or corrective punishment, as
opposed to a purely retributive punishment ( _timōria_ ). Whereas eonian life
with God “is clearly an _end in itself_ —that is, valuable or worth having for
its own sake—the punishment ( _kolasis_ ) is just as clearly a _means to an
end._ “4 If the reading of _kolasis_ as corrective punishment is correct, then
that end can only be reconciliation with God. Talbott, however, recognizes
that Christ’s choice of _kolasis_ alone is not decisive. “The language of
correction and that of retribution often get completely mixed up in ordinary
linguistic contexts,” he remarks.5

Unwilling to put all of his eggs in the _kolasis_ basket, Talbott returns to
the question of _aiōnios_. Talbott offers the following proposal: “Eternal
punishment is simply punishment of any duration that has its causal source in
the eternal purposes of God.”6 Consider, for example, Jude 7, which speaks of
the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by _puros aiōniou_. Clearly this fire
did not burn perpetually—it did end after consuming everything; it is not
burning today—yet most English translations of the New Testament render the
Greek as “eternal fire.” In what sense, then, can it be said to be eternal?
The most plausible answer: it is a fire that _comes from God_. Talbott then
applies the same reasoning to the Parable of the Last Judgment:

How reliable is Barclay here? Not very. I have no idea what he means when he
says that _aiōnios_ “can only really be applied to God,” when it is widely
used in Greek literature and the Septuagint in so many diverse ways. Barclay
appears to be positing a continuity between Plato (4th century B.C.), who
apparently invented the word _aiōnios_ to signify the absolute timelessness of
deity, and the New Testament, without however mentioning that Aristotle and
many other Greek philosophers did not adopt Plato’s usage and preferred
instead to use the term _aïdios_ to signify divine eternity. Reading Plato
into the New Testament is a questionable enterprise, as Talbott I think would
agree.

My simplistic understanding : If we are metering out punishment to our own
children , it should be because we love them. Its crazy to think we would
punish our children, just because their wrong must be punished. If punishing
is not going to fix the wrong ,then punishment has no purpose … unless I’m
missing something. We are Gods family and not sitting in a court room.

I find Talbott’s interpretation plausible, but am disappointed that he did not
update this section of the 2nd edition of his book in light of more recent
scholarship. He relies excessively on William Barclay, who claims that in the
New Testament “ _aiōnios_ is distinctively the word of eternity . . . it can
properly describe only that which essentially belongs to and befits God.”8 And

[2] Basil of Caesarea, _Rules Briefly Treated_ 267\. Some scholars question
whether this passage might be an interpolation into the Basilean monastic
rule. They deem unlikely that Basil would speak so harshly of his universalist
siblings, Macrina and Gregory. They also point to evidence that suggests that
Basil himself believed in universal salvation. See Ilaria Ramelli, “[Basil and
Apokatastasis](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/st-basil-and-
apokatastasis.pdf),” _Journal of Early Christian History_ , 4 (2014): 116-125.

Contrast Barclay with the semantic analysis of Ilaria Ramelli and David
Konstan. The authors survey the use of _aiōnios_ and _aïdios_ in classical and
biblical literature, including the Septuagint. They conclude their survey of
New Testament usage thusly:

> The point here was not that the fire literally burned forever without
> consuming these cities and continues to burn even today. The point was that
> the fire is a form of divine judgment upon these cities, a foreshadowing of
> eschatological judgment, and that its causal source lies in the eternal God

> which Jesus alluded in Matthew 25:41 and 46 respectively: like the fire that
> consumed Sodom and Gomorrah, this fire will not be eternal in the sense that
> it will burn forever without consuming anything—without consuming, for

> in the sense that it continues forever without accomplishing its corrective
> purpose. Both the fire and the punishment are eternal in the twofold sense

> eternal in the sense that it is the eternal God who does it.7

By the way, do you have *any* opinion at all about the alleged apparitions at
Zeitoun?  
I can recall the phenomena that occurred there but I never knew what to make
of them, personally… Any idea?

So with visions, people understood them through a matrix of taking infernalism
for granted, and understood what they experienced, even if true through that.

Chris, I have to presume that the visions you mention were not truly sent by
God.

Fatima is one of the great examples of religious fraud inducing mass hysteria.
God is not an idiot, and only an idiot would have issued the ridiculously
vacuous “prophecies” of the peasant girls who faked the visions. There is a
reason why peasant girls, with no prospects in life except hard work, marriage
to an undesirable man, occasional beatings, and death in childbed, make up
stories to elevate themselves out of their conditions. Something similar
happened at La Salette.

I don’t see any important distinction between “unto”and “for.” I might just as
well have reversed them “for rectification to all” or used the same
translation for both. I was just trying to make it sound idiomatically
clearer; but Paul’s Greek is…Paul’s Greek.

Well, all that occurs to me at the moment is Our Lady of Zeitoun, the visions
being seen chiefly by Coptic Orthodox believers.

Indeed, you make two very important points. While one can find plenty of
passages of unpleasantries many are mistranslated out of context and do not
describe hell as such. Expectation skews judgment: if we are told to look for
an everlasting hell, sure enough we will find one.

Perhaps the visions were true, perhaps not. But lets assume they a geninue
mystic experiences, and any kind of deceptions, all mystic experiences are
mediated via the mind, spirit and understanding of the persons, their society,
culture, views and worldview, having them.

[5] “Hence it is entirely possible that Paul may have had a basic idea that
some “eschatological” events, e.g. apparently consigning some people to what
might otherwise appear to be final and definitive rejection or destruction is
not the final word, or the final event, in the eschatological drama to unfold
at the End. As with, say, 1 Cor 15.22a alongside v. 22b, it might be better to
take all that Paul says seriously, and moreover to give him the courtesy of
granting that he may mean exactly what he says (or not presuming that we know
him better than he knows himself and claiming that he does not mean what he
appears to say). With this approach, the universalist claims of Paul can then
be accommodated within an overall (apocalyptic) picture of the ultimate End
for all human beings: it may be that, at present, some can be described as
“perishing,” “condemned,” “lost,” or whatever. But this is not God’s final
word. The ultimate  
hope is that, in the end, all will indeed be saved and that God will be all in
all.” Christopher Tuckett, “[Paul and
Universalism](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/tuckett-on-paul-and-
universalism.pdf),” in _Revealed Wisdom_ , ed. John Ashton (2014), pp.
168-169.

I am referring, of course, to passages which describe fiery furnaces, outer
darkness, gnashing of teeth, endless weeping, mourning, unquenchable flames,
and such.

By the way, I know there was a boy involved in both cases. But the girls took
the lead.

While reading this chapter I kept wondering, what would the New Perspective
folk think about this. How do they interpret Romans 5:18? Well, it just so
happens that I have the commentaries of N. T. Wright and James D. G. Dunn
sitting on my bookshelf. First, Wright:

> For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon
> all. (Rom 11:32)
>
> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. (1 Cor
> 15:22)

> In each of these texts, we encounter a contrast between two universal
> statements, and in each case the first “all” determines the scope of the

> “act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all,” he evidently

> he had in mind every human whom God has “shut up to,” or has “imprisoned
> in,” disobedience; and when he asserted in 1 Corinthians 15:22 that “all

> seems to me, of a grasping at straws.4

Likewise Calvin, although I am not Catholic, something compelling seems to
have happened at Fatima. The explanation of mass hysteria is, to my mind,
unsatisfactory and is something that’s best left in the pages of publications
like Skeptic magazine.

Just my two cents, but I also think it’s interesting how alleged visions of
the Virgin almost always happen in Catholic countries and almost never occur
in Orthodox nations in spite of the fact that the Orthodox revere Mary just as
much as the Catholics – and also, they’re about 300 million worldwide (all
Orthodox believers combined, both Eastern and Oriental), which is roughly the
equivalent of 90% of the population of the US.  
And the Virgin never seems to reveal herself to Protestant Christians (guess
she really hates their guts for failing to worship her) or to non-
denominational Christians either…  
I guess all these people really have to do in order to have a shot at being
visited by the Holy Virgin is believe in the “One True Church”…  
…Which is, of course, the one Church that promoted blatantly false doctrines
based on early mistranslations from Greek to Latin to the rank of actual
infallible dogmas (among them, the Catholic-Protestant conception of Original
Sin, with its attached notion of inherited guilt, which is at once
nonsensical, unbiblical, and unworthy of God – what a rare feat).

Perhaps – but we get these type of dark visions about the nature of hell from
the biblical accounts as well. Most universalists do not deny the existence of
hell, nor that it is a dark and terrible place. I take such visions to convey
what is at stake here, the seriousness of the matter. However in the never-
ending eternal account of hell, it is darkness that holds the ultimate trump
card and thus overcomes the light, and this is precisely what is explicitly
denied by universalists. There is no trump card, there is nothing that can
overcome and outlast the relentless, never-ending love and mercy of God. These
visions of hell then need to be understood in the light of the character of
God, his kindness, his beauty, his goodness.

Okay.  
Not really surprised, given the number of subjects you’ve evidently studied in
depth… No one can know everything.

Though I will admit that, after the rain, there might have been a parhelic
iridescence caused by ice crystals. I’ve seen that happen once myself. But
only a few could be found who claimed to have seen it, so even that is
doubtful.

In the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (III.3.11, 440C-441) He makes mention of the
“fall” and says that human nature/soul “fell in to danger of non-existence and
destruction.” Is this a danger to which ultimately was a possibility from
which one is saved, or is this merely logically pushing a conversation in
which one was never in any real danger because when you couple it with the
fact that any existent intelligibility must me oriented to the good, and thus,
since we continue to exist we would never be in any danger of non-
existence/destruction at all?

Dunn: How…can grace be “so much more” in its effect if it is less universal
than the effect of death?

Ah, yes, correct, there’s that one (even though Egypt is of course
predominantly Sunni Muslim rather than Christian Orthodox).  
Now that you remind me of it, there have been at least 2 or 3 *other* alleged
Marian apparitions in Egypt, including in Shoubra, which is also in Cairo, and
in Assiut, another Egyptian city.

But it’s been decades since I last read up on this. You can probably find it
online somewhere.

Or is he surmising that essentially you strip away yourself in to non-
being/lack of existence the further removed you become? So that in a sense,
you almost become Plotinian matter, and you are non-being that contributes
merely to someone else’s good to be removed in the end?

It is perfectly legitmate, in my opinion, if you think there is something in a
vision to be listened to, to not have to accept elements of the recievers
interpretation that cannot be true to God, such as infernalism. In fact, it
would be imperative to do so, if it were a true vision, then intrepreting it
correctly would be something important for all believers to strive for (and
not simply take one intrpretation, even from those having them, as written in
stone).

Thomas Talbott devotes two chapters of [_The Inescapable Love of
God_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625646909/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp89&creative25&creativeASIN25646909&linkCode=as2&tagìlectorthod-20&linkId=POSHW7IT6Z6MZM4A)
to direct engagement with the New Testament and its commentators. He believes
that the universalist hope is so plainly expressed in the New Testament, and
particularly in the writings of St Paul, that we must wonder “why so many
Christian theologians have struggled heroically to _explain it away._ “3 The
brevity of a blog article does not permit me to survey and summarize his
exegesis of the important texts nor his critical analysis of various
commentators. Consider, for example, this well-known verse from the Epistle to
the Romans:

Away with you pitiful demons and repent for there’s One greater than you that
has come to claim His own!

It is the Wrath of the Love of God. Western Christians would do well to return
to an understanding of the Divine Simplicity – the last thing God is is a
schizophrenic balancing two sides, and if it looks that way to us, it because
we have misunderstood. There is no antinomy in the line, “So that He might be
Just and the Justifier of the Wicked,” for there is no injustice in making the
wicked to be just. Rather, that is supreme justice: that all shall be just.
All shall be what it must be.

For a long time it’s been known that, while thousands of people were present,
only a handful reported seeing anything special. About seven in all, to go by
the accounts of the time. Then the tale grew in the telling. Scientists who
were present, including believers, saw nothing. Other legendary material soon
accrued to the tale, such as the claim of driving rain all day beforehand that
soaked the ground, and then the ground miraculously became dry…. All rubbish.
Pictures of the crowd gathering for hours beforehand showed a clear dry day.
One newspaper reported a small drizzle earlier in the day, and then that too
was exaggerated.

Actually, there are no such depictions of “Hell” anywhere in scripture. In
Luke there’s a description of Hades, borrowed from Enoch probably, which
includes both places of darkness and places of light and refreshment. But a
Hell is never described at all.

Since DBH seems to be responding, I have an interesting (I think question) via
a quote from Pseudo-Dionysius and really just in general I guess about the
road that his Neo-Platonism runs into via a quote he makes himself. And do we
just kind of chalk it up to the time, or does he genuinely think this or would
he kind of be like Maximus in that if you look at it in toto, it could only
lead to an actualized universalist position?

Well, the “outer darkness” and “gnashing of teeth” are problems of
translation. The actual picture is of people outside at night grinding their
teeth in complaint at not being allowed into the party. The “inextinguishable”
fire is just an image of rubbish and carrion disposal, not of torture; as is
also the case with the furnaces. And none of it is an image of Hell, as
unpleasant as it may sound.

Still, in comparison to the incredible number of alleged Marian apparitions
that have supposedly occurred across Catholic lands throughout the centuries
(thousands upon thousands of alleged apparitions, that is), the number of
apparitions that have supposedly occurred in the Orthodox world… Seems to have
been *almost* negligible, as far as I know.

These are strong words. “All” means all.5 Talbott, of course, is well aware
that a single verse does not prove Christian doctrine; but after surveying
some of the modern Reformed and evangelical commentary tradition, he questions
whether those who reject the universalist reading of Romans 5:18 have
legitimate exegetical reasons for doing so. Is it not possible that antecedent
doctrinal or philosophical commitments are driving the exegesis?

Look, think about it. If thousands claimed to have a vision, where are their
testimonies? Why do no contemporary reports make such claims? It has become
common to claim thousands had a vision, but the claim is based on nothing.

Thousands did not. That was a claim made after the fact. In reality, it was
almost impossible to find people who described the supposed vision. It’s a
case of a legend about a mass experience taking shape after the crowd had long
dispersed. Similarly the reports of convinced atheists seeing miracles. Actual
reconstructions of reports after the fact revealed a lot of claims that were
never substantiated. A few pious souls expecting a promised vision saw or
thought they saw something, except their accounts were inconsistent. It’s
nonsense. It never happened. It’s precisely the sort of mass “sighting” that
takes place in all religious traditions at moments of mass fervor.

Yes, but were the alleged witnesses Orthodox themselves?  
For example, I can think of at least one alleged Marian apparition that
occurred several decades ago (at some point during the last decades of the
20th century, if memory serves me well) in Ukraine, obviously an Orthodox-
majority country…  
…But they occurred in a mostly *Catholic* region of the country (in one of
Ukraine’s westernmost raions) and the alleged seers (or seer, I can’t
remember) was/were at least one young girl that just “happened” to be Catholic
(she might have been a member of the Polish minority or perhaps an Eastern
Catholic ethnic Ukrainian).  
I’d be interested to learn more, though… Maybe I overestimated my knowledge,
that wouldn’t be the first time.  
Do you have any *relatively* recent examples in mind?

Father, I’m a Roman Catholic who appreciates your work and has read Hart.
Thank you. I would like to ask, how might you reconcile church approved
visions of hell, such as Our Lady of Fatima showed the children in Portugal,
or Saint Faustina saw? I’m of sound mind, but I have panic attacks over these
horrifying warnings. They disgust me to the point that I hate the God I’m
trying to love. They are akin to me warning my 3 year old that monsters will
climb in his window and eat him and steal him away from mommy and daddy for
the rest of his life if he doesn’t eat his vegetables. What a sick jerk I
would have to be to make that threat. The same church that approves these
visions permits me to hope that all may be saved. I can’t make sense of this!
I’ve read Balthazar, hart, you, and Talbot, and it make sense! I would be
grateful for your perspective. Thanks

Not a strong argument against the universalist interpretation, if I do say so
myself. On the basis of Paul’s earlier discussion of judgment by works in
2:5-11, Wright infers that Paul cannot strictly mean what he appears to say in
5:18. I wonder what would happen if he were to read 2:5-10 in light of 5:18,
instead of the reverse. If we are justified by the atoning work of the cross,
as Wright insists, what role, if any, do works really play in our
justifi­ca­tion by and in Christ? And why is it not possible that the
justification by works of Rom 2 includes the “works” of repentance and faith
brought about in the hearts of the wicked in the purgative fire of God’s
uncreated light?

Though not a professional biblical scholar, Talbott brings to his reading of
the Scriptures a philosopher’s acuity and a precision of analysis. Ultimately
he invites us to look at St Paul and the other books of the New Testament with
fresh eyes and a renewed heart.

Wright attempts to establish the comparison (“just as…so also”) as obtaining
between the merely potential effects of the two acts, not their ‘actual
effect’. And that’s the problem. First, it seems extremely difficult
(impossible?) to suppose Paul has in mind only the potential effects of Adam’s
act since the former (those of Adam’s disobedience) obtain matter of factly in
us. And secondly, on Wright’s reading the “just as…so also” is weakened unto
pointlessness. Thirdly, there’s often a translation involving adding a verb
“to lead” which inclines in favor of Wright’s reading – i.e., Adam did
something “that led to” our condemnation, and so also Christ doesn’t something
that only “leads to” justification. But the Greek doesn’t make this point
explicitly at all. The Greek is quite literally and tersely (DBH’s
translation): “So then, just as by one trespass unto condemnation for all
human beings, so also by one act of righteousness unto rectification of life
for all human beings.” No verb at all.

Even some of the most terrible views of the past, can sometimes be understood
in a way that can change everything. For example, the view that the saved will
have their joy increased in watching the damnation of the lost, if understood
and re-interpreted from a universalist perspective as the salvation and
freedom of all people from their false shadow selves, and the all suffering
and loss that comes from it, that do not exist, it can be understood as the
delight of all in the freedom to their true selves and from death into life.
That in the distorted and very damaged understanding of those persons saying
such things, this is a truth they could only dimly grasp, and only understood
it through the distortions cast by the shadows of death, twisting a joyous
truth into a macabre and terrifying horror.

The universalist confessor faces what appears to be an insurmountable
challenge—reconciling his convictions with the _plain_ and _obvious_ testimony
of the Holy Scriptures. Traditional Christians have long believed in the real
possibility of everlasting damnation because this is, so they have long
believed, what the Scriptures teach. Jesus taught eternal hell. The Apostles
taught eternal hell. It’s all there in the Bible. Yet this plain teaching was
not so plain in the early centuries of the Church. When Origen, perhaps the
greatest biblical exegete of the patristic period, unrolled the sacred
scrolls, he read them as declaring apokatastasis; nor was his an idiosyncratic
opinion.1 Well over a century after the death of Origen, St Augustine of Hippo
found it necessary to subject the universalist hope to lengthy criticism. He
called the proponents of this hope _nostri misericordes_ , “our party of
pity,” and numbered them as “indeed very many.”2 Because of their
sentimentality and false sense of compassion, the _misericordes_ evade the
plain, and harsh, meaning of the biblical texts. This judgment has been
reiterated down the ages ever since. When Western Christians read the New
Testament on everlasting punishment, they read it through the eyes of
Augustine.

> Then as one man’s trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man’s act
> of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men. (Rom 5:18)

If DBH is around, I wonder if he’d share some of this thought on his
translation of the two “eis” phrases – in the first case of each as “unto” and
in the 2nd of each as “for.” Both are eis+accusative, and he takes them as
signifying slightly different relations: “unto” introducing the primary effect
of the cause in each case, and “for” introducing, indirectly, those upon/for
whom this effect comes. Is that it? I also wonder how common it is to see
these ‘stacked’ consecutively like this. Just a thought.

If anything, that was my own personal experience in coming to the place where
I am now: Hell, as in the sense of eternal damnation, without repentance,
without forgiveness, without redemption, is an affront to Justice, not in that
it is an injustice to man, but in that it is an injustice to the Lamb slain
from the foundations of the world.

So what’s your explanation a couple thousand people, including convinced
atheists, reporting similar bizarre phenomena at the same time? Not trying to
be snide, genuinely curious.

And, of course, besides this, as I understand it, you are not required to
accept either visions as geninue, so if they do not conform to who God is then
you can just safely ignore them. This is probably a safer path with visions
anyway, easy to get yourself lost, worried and confused uncessarily by it all,
when it’s better to pay attention Christ and who He reveals God to be.

problem posed by Rom 2:5-10 within the context of Paul’s positive presentation
of justification in Romans. An easy reconciliation seems to be impossible.
Douglas Campbell has controversially proposed that the entirety of Romans
1:18-3:20 is a diatribe in which Paul engages in conversation with his
opponents. If true, then Rom 2:5-10 does not express Paul’s opinion: see “[Was

“This is one of those many verses in Paul more honored in the paraphrase than
in the literal rendering. From the context, one can tell what he is saying:
that just as one transgression (or the transgression of one man) brought
condemnation to all human beings, so by one rectifying act (or the rectifying
act of one man) all human beings receive a rectification of life (meaning
either a rectification of their lives or a rectification imparted by the life
of the risen Christ). The actual Greek text, however, is not only so terse as
to be practically a shorthand jotting, but ungrammatical as well; if anything,
my translation here somewhat veils the rushed brokenness of the original. The
strict proportionality of the formulation, however, is quite clear, here and
in the surrounding verses: just as the first sin brought condemnation and
death to absolutely everyone, so Christ’s act of righteousness brings
righteousness and life to absolutely everyone. Whether intentional or not, the
plain meaning of the verse is that of universal condemnation annulled by
universal salvation.”

          * ![](https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ebaa14854c64ef7502a57d7bdecedef9?s=40&d=identicon&r=G) Robert Fortuin says:

Dunn here offers a far superior exegesis of the text than Wright. He is taking
Paul’s language seriously and therefore has to wonder whether the Apostle has
stretched his language for rhetorical effect. At the same time, Dunn
acknowledges the possibility that Paul may well have entertained a
universalist vision. That at least is what the verse seems to directly state.
But Dunn is cautious. He does not see how one can reconcile such a vision with
the evangelical demand for faith and repentance. Note how he, like Wright,
also appeals to Romans 2. Again I ask, how can we exclude the conversion and
transformation of the wicked in Gehenna? Paul hints at this possibility in his
First Letter to the Corinthians:

Well said Grant, a good word of caution to take visions loosely, as “with a
grain of salt.”

At face value the text plainly supports a strong universalist hope; but the
important question arises: does “all” mean the same thing in the first clause
as it does in the second? If one is committed to the doctrine of eternal
reprobation, then the answer to this question must be no. Yet consider similar
constructions found elsewhere in the Pauline corpus:

It is not at all obvious that when Paul speaks of the day of wrath, he is
thinking of everlasting retributive punishment. Talbott refers us to another
“all” text, already cited above: “For God has consigned all men to
disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom 11:32). He then comments:

This is a thread that is strung throughout the Bible. God is called Love – he
is never called Wrath. Yes, he is called a Purifying Fire, and in that
context, think through all the uses of the word Fire, and recall how much in
the Old Testament he is compared to a metalworker refining gold.

JUST AS:  
– by (dia) one trespass  
– unto (eis) condemnation  
– for (eis) all  
SO ALSO:  
– By (dia) one act of righteousness  
– unto (eis) rectification  
– for (eis) all

Nothing explains itself or intpreprets themselves, but is understood via the
understanding and hermeneutic of the persons involved. This is clear
throughout the development of what we know as the OT Scriptures, there are
much that are simply irreconcilable with other books within it, let alone the
NT taken as a plain reading (denial of ressurection, views of God, afterlife,
spirits etc), original sources coming from very different times and places.
It’s also why no one recongised Jesus for who He is, and the disciples only
understood after the Resurrection when they understood everything through Him
and about Him, was the veil as St Paul puts it, lifted from their eyes.

Given the parallelism of the two clauses in each sentence, one would expect
each “all” to refer to the same class, namely, all human beings. Talbott
comments:

[3] Thomas Talbott, _The Inescapable Love of God_ , 2nd ed., p. 49. See
Talbott’s article “[How to Read the Bible From a Universalist
Perspective](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/how-to-read-the-bible-
from-a-universalist-perspective/).”

Perhaps in this text Paul is thinking of believers, yet he also indicates the
possibility of rectification apart from works, which have been burned away by
the eschatological fire. The grace of Christ knows no limits! It extends even
to the worst of sinners. The Lord justifies the ungodly!

Campbell thus supports what he calls a forensic-liberative construal of
justification. Contrary to traditional Protestant exegetes who see the act of
justification as a deliverance from the retributive wrath of God, Campbell
understands it as apocalyptic deliverance from the powers that oppress
humanity:

In light of the God revealed in Jesus Christ, istm questions like this are
unprofitable and nonsensical. If a professing Christian should answer yes to
this question, I would suspect that there was something deeply disordered in
her understanding of the nature and calling of Christian faith. God is love,
and He has hardwired an intuitive understanding of what love is into our
hearts (and has given us innumerable pictures of love in action in Christ and
the Saints to help us get in touch with that part of our heart), or we are
simply lost. At least that is how it seems to me.

Of course, I do not define God’s “unconditional love” (or “mercy”) as endless
permissiveness or simply warm fuzziness–I do not view God as a sort of all-
powerful indulgent Grandpa! To be honest, in light of the ascetic tradition
followed by the likes of St. Isaac the Syrian and also St. Silouan the
Athonite, two saints renowned for having and articulating this profound sense
of the depth of God’s mercy, I find it a bit annoying when that is how others
then construe the meaning of this Orthodox understanding of God as all-
merciful love.

Paul then goes on to say, “But they are justified freely by his grace through
the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” Sinners are righteoused freely,
gratuitously, undeservedly, for nothing ( _dorean_ ). And to make this point
even more emphatic, Paul adds “by his grace” ( _charis_ ). “‘Grace,’ Wright
explains, “is one of Paul’s most potent shorthand terms, carrying in its
beautiful simplicity the entire story of God’s love, active in Christ and the
Spirit to do for humans what they could never do for themselves” (p. 471).
Here is the heart of the gospel!

“But now,” the Apostle declaims, “the righteousness of God has been
disclosed.” St Paul returns to the previously announced theme of his letter:
“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to
everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For the
righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel from faith to faith, just as it
is written, ‘The righteous by faith will live'” (Rom 1:16-17). [As we have
seen](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/ruminating-romans-dikaiosyne-
theou/), the divine righteousness is properly interpreted as God’s saving
power and covenant fidelity. It can only be understood within the relationship
and bonds God has established with his people. In the 4th century Latin
exegete Ambrosiaster discerned the heart of the matter: “Therefore, what seems
to be mercy is actually called the righteousness of God, because it was based
on the promise; the fulfilling of God’s promise is called the righteousness of
God. To accomplish what one has promised is itself righteousness. Moreover,
because to refuse refuge to those fleeing to God would be evil, to grant
refuge is also righteousness” ([ _The Church’s Bible:
Romans_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802825753/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0802825753&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),
p. 73).

In 1:17 Paul says that the divine righteousness is revealed in the gospel. In
3:21-26 we learn that the gospel is not only _about_ Jesus the Messiah but
that he _is_ the gospel. The _dikaiosynê theou_ is revealed in the
faithfulness of Jesus Christ, declares Paul. In our [analysis of Gal
2:15-21](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/ruminating-romans-faithing-
in-the-faith-of-christ/), we saw that the faithfulness of Christ, consummated
in the cross, is the apocalyptic event by which God has put the world to
rights and delivered humanity from the powers of sin, the flesh, and the
devil. The kingdom has come—not by military conquest but the the power of love
enacted through suffering and death.

On another note, are you familiar with Fr. Louis Bouyer? He was one of the
conciliar reformers, a peritus, and a pioneer of the Catholic patristic
resourcement, though he was ultimately horrified by much of the council’s
legacy (revolutions always eat their children…). Anyway, I think you might
appreciate his thoughts about St. Paul, and the Christian faith as a whole.
Have you ever read his “The Spirituality of the New Testament and the
Fathers”? Quite good. His description of the Apostle is delightful:

Such a being would not be God, for He would not be “that than which nothing
greater can be conceived.” He might be the greatest and most powerful being
among the other beings that exist, but his being would be a limited one.

I agree that “God is love” — though I might disagree with you concerning what
exactly that “looks” like — but I find it dangerous to begin with a set of
attributes and then go in search of a deity.

Years ago I read a remarkable book by Rabbi Pinchas Lapide: [_The Resurrection
of Jesus: A Jewish
Perspective_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157910908X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=157910908X&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20).
Lapide acknowledges that given the historical evidence Jesus probably was
raised from the dead by God; but he still rejects the critical claim of the
Christian Church that Jesus was the Messiah. Why? Because his resurrection did
not in fact usher in the kingdom. Israel has not been delivered from her
oppressors, justice and peace have not been established, evil has not been
conquered, the general resurrection and final judgment have not occurred. “If
it is true that the Messiah of which our ancient prophets spoke has already
come,” Lapide asks, “how then do you explain the present state of the world?”
Hence he still awaits the coming of the Messiah. In his [dialogue with Jurgen
Moltmann](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579109853/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1579109853&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),
Lapide remarks that “should the coming one be Jesus, he would be precisely as
welcome to us as any other whom God would designate as the redeemer of the
world. If he would only come!” Amen.

Would it matter to your faith if the creator of heaven and earth were Allah?

“But now” … After the long, and sometimes painful, discussion of the wrath and
judgment of God in 1:18-3:20, the reader of Romans may be excused for exhaling
a sigh of relief and muttering “finally.” Perhaps one day I will have a better
grasp of how to interpret the references to and stories about divine
retribution in Holy Scripture. I don’t want to rationalize them away and thus
dilute the biblical witness; but neither am I satisfied just to accept them at
face value. The evangelical and spiritual cost is too high. The God revealed
in Jesus Christ is _absolute love_ and _unconditional grace_. If he is not,
why be a Christian?

Thanks so much for covering this topic. I really appreciate how you’re
carefully parsing the claims of Campbell, Martyn, etc., and asking us to
really think through what we’ve come to uncritically accept as “justification-
by-faith-alone,” as if this was all that Paul was trying to get at.

(This understanding of justification as liberative deliverance through the
faithfulness of Christ has important consequences for our understanding of
divine wrath. Do you see why?)

Paul is concerned to demonstrate that all that is happening in and through the
gospel is happening in fulfillment of the Scriptures (“attested by the law and
the prophets”); yet clearly the fulfillment has taken everyone by surprise.
This is not how things were supposed to go. In light of his encounter with the
risen Messiah, Paul realizes he must now re-read the Scriptures with a new
pair of glasses; he must read them in and through the crucified and risen
Jesus. The narrative of salvation _begins_ with the Nazarene, and the
preceding story must now be read retrospectively. Pascha is our hermeneutic.

I hope my conviction that God is absolute love and unconditional grace is not
something I have simply made up. I think I learned this from the New
Testament. Yet I acknowledge that there is “data” in the Bible and Christian
tradition that contradicts it. I think this may deserve an article of its own.
Once I get through Romans 4, I’m going to take a break from ruminations and do
some reading and writing on other stuff.

The saving power and covenant faithfulness of God is revealed, Paul declares,
in the faithfulness of Jesus Christ unto death. N. T. Wright elaborates
further:

Forgive me if my saying so offends in any way, but these are the sorts of
comments wherein you begin to sound an awful lot like a Calvinist to me in
your seeming “dread of the Divine Sovereignty” (as they conceive it).

Many commentators on Romans believe that Paul has incorporated a traditional
creedal or liturgical formula in vv 24-26. Joseph Fitzmyer proposes that the
formula may have gone something like the following: “being justified freely
through redemption (which comes) in Christ Jesus, whom God presented as a
means of expiating sin [ _hilastērion_ ] through his blood, as a manifestation
of his uprightness for the pardon of past sins committed in the time of his
forbearance” ([ _Anchor Bible:
Romans_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300140789/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0300140789&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),
p. 342). If this is true, this might explain the use of specific words (
_hilastērion_ being the most notable) that do not appear elsewhere in the
Pauline corpus.

Posted on [26 August
2013](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/ruminating-romans-

Theoretically, would you not worship God if he failed to exhibit “absolute
love and unconditional grace”? Let us say that Allah is the one true God.
Would you not worship Him?

“The God revealed in Jesus Christ is absolute love and unconditional grace. If
he is not, why be a Christian?”

In any case, I agree with Fr. Aidan–it’s good to have you on the comments
thread. Your comments are always guaranteed to provoke good, robust
discussion! 🙂

“All have sinned,” Paul observes. That at least is clear from the preceding
exposition in 1:18-3:20. But perhaps most importantly, “all are under the
power of sin” (Rom 3:9). It is not just a matter of being guilty of individual
transgressions—presumably one could just repent of them or offer sacrifice—but
of domination by a malevolent power. Paul will elaborate further on the power
of sin later in his epistle.

As God redeemed Israel from slavery in Egypt, so God through the cross of
Christ has now redeemed humanity from bondage to death and sin.

One of the more promising aspects of the intersection between Apocalyptic
Theology and Eastern Orthodoxy (and some forms of Anglicanism) is not only the
strong Patristic notion of salvation-as-deification, but the role of Temple
imagery in the NT. I don’t have a lot of time to explicate this now, but have
you found any connections? You might have already written on this topic, so
apologies if I just missed it. Quickly, it seems to me that Apocalyptic
Theology seems to stress the primacy of a liturgical world and it’s always
struck me as interesting how the Eastern Orthodox church has maintained this
notion of concrete forms of faith. I’m thinking her of Margaret Barker’s
opening to The Great High Priest: “Until my experience of the Orthodox
Liturgy, I had restricted my own researches to ancient text. My own
confessional background being Bible-based rather than Liturgy-based, it had
never occurred to me that Liturgy opened up a whole new world, or rather,
showed me a world that I already knew very well?” (xii).

The words we speak of God must have a meaning which human beings are capable
of understanding. Hence, if we say that God is love, this must mean that His
love for us is, in some sense, like human love and, indeed, surpasses the
highest expressions of human love that can be found on earth. What is the
highest expression of love on earth? Well, I would think that one candidate
for this would be the love that parents have for their children. Such love is
as absolute and unconditional as mere creatures can get. And, lo and behold,
what do we find in sacred scripture? Well, we find that it is precisely this
love of a father for his children that is used to express God’s love for us.
The story of the prodigal son makes very clear the unconditional nature of
this love.  
Now, some might argue that we shouldn’t come to scripture with our
preconceived notion of love and then impose it on God. What are we to make of
such an assertion? How else can we understand what scripture means by “God is
love” than by comparing it to the best examples in our own experience? Are to
say that, though true human love excludes cruelty, divine love does not? If
this be so, then let’s apply such thinking to the other attributes of God. For
instance, God is truth itself. But since we shouldn’t try to impose on God our
own human conceptions of truth, we should allow that truth in God might be
compatible with deception and lying. Again, God is faithful to His promises,
but, since we shouldn’t try to impose our own notion of faithfulness on God,
we should allow that God’s faithfulness might be compatible with breaking His
promises. What kind of nonsense is this? It would make a sham of revelation.  
God’s unconditional love and mercy for us means simply this: that, in spite of
our sins, God’s disposition towards us is only love and mercy. Nor is this
disposition of God in any way dependent on our response to Him. If it were, He
would not constantly and relentlessly seek us out. What is required of us is
simply to accept His love and mercy. This is easier said than done. For to
accept God’s love is to accept His correction. To accept His mercy is to be
willing to allow God to show us the ways in which we have betrayed HIs love by
our sins.

Campbell’s exegesis returns us to the notion of _performative_ rectification
discussed in “[Is Justification
Forensic](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/ruminating-romans-is-
justification-forensic/)?” Wright, along with most classical Protestant
exegetes, dispute this “catholic” interpretation. He understands it as purely
declarative, as ratifying or confirming that which is (namely, “you belong to
the eschatological people of God”). Wright departs from his fellow Protestant
exegetes by focusing on the ecclesiological dimension rather than the
soteriological, but they agree on a forensic-declarative construal. But as we
are seeing, there are compelling reasons to understand the Apostle Paul as
redefining justification by grace as a performative act. When God justifies a
sinner, he does more than ratify that a change has previously taken place; he
does more than confer a legal status. He actually changes the sinner. His Word
accomplishes what he intends and does not return to him empty. Wright’s fellow
New Perspectivist E. P. Sanders also supports an effective reading of
_dikaioō_. “The passive verb ‘to be righteoused’ in Paul’s letters almost
always means to be changed,” he explains, “to be transferred from one realm to
another: from sin to obedience, from death to life, from being under the law
to being under grace. While some words beginning with _dik_ are judicial in
Paul, the passive verb seldom is (only in 1 Cor. 4:4; 6:11; Rom. 2:13), and it
is the passive verb which bears the brunt of the argument in Galatians 2-3 and
Romans 3-4″ ([
_Paul_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192854518/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0192854518&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),

Interpretation](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Paul's+use+of+dikaio-+terminology%3A+moving+beyond+N.+T.+Wright's...-a0265290416)“).

“Theoretically, would you not worship God if he failed to exhibit “absolute
love and unconditional grace”? ”

“What we do see very clearly … what betrays itself in almost every page of his
epistles … is his excessive sensibility, tempered by flashes of sarcastic
humor, hiding or revealing a heart of truly magnanimous generosity. Choleric,
authoritarian and yet argumentative, but with a profound common sense and an
exceptional power of intuition, absolute in his judgement and yet capable of a
compassion going as far as tenderness, uninterested in anything that did not
have a religious aspect and yet amazingly human — St. Paul is a figure of the
Jewish and Christian spiritual man whom one needs to become familiar with …
Always vividly alive, one of the least conventional and most appealingly
saintly personalities of all history.”

![](https://i0.wp.com/i93.photobucket.com/albums/l77/afkimel/Misc/ark-of-the-
covenant_zps88146eb1.jpg)Paul then introduces the symbolism of the mercy seat
( _hilastērion_ ). In the Septuagint
[_hilastērion_](http://www.tyndalehouse.com/tynbul/library/TynBull_2000_51_1_09_Bailey_JesusMercySeat.pdf)
(Hebrew _kapporet_ ) is used to denote the gold cover, “mercy seat,” that was
placed over the ark of the covenant. On the Day of Atonement the priest would
sprinkle the blood of the sacrificed goat upon the mercy seat. “No mere item
of furniture,” elucidates Brendan Bryne, “the _kapporet_ came to be seen as
the focus of the cleansing and renewing presence of God, on the occasion when
God ‘wiped away’ the stain of all the accumulated sins of the previous year,
inaugurating a fresh epoch of covenant relations between Israel and her God
(Lev 16:2-16)” ([
_Romans_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814658083/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0814658083&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),
p. 127). It appears that the Jewish-Christian tradition antedating Paul in
some way identified Jesus with the _hilastērion_ and the sacrificial ritual of
the Day of Atonement. We probably should not, however, seek in this language
an explanation of how Paul, or the earlier tradition, understood the mechanism
of atonement. Not only are attempts to precisely state how the Temple
sacrifices “worked” futile; but Paul’s own apocalyptic vision of justification
moves beyond the remission and sacrificial expiation of transgressions. We
certainly should not import notions of propitiation into this verse. What is
important here is the symbolism, not the explanation. The Crucified is himself
the mercy seat, the place of God’s cleansing, renewing, and liberating power.

God’s act of rectification, says Paul, is accomplished through “the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.” “Redemption” translates the Greek word
_apolytrōsis_. The word is typically interpreted as a ransom paid to redeem a
slave, an interpretation favored by advocates of penal substitutionary
atonement; but Douglas Campbell argues that the word should be interpreted
more generally, namely, release, liberation, or deliverance from bondage ([The
Deliverance of
God](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802870732/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0802870732&linkCode=as2&tag=eclectorthod-20),
pp. 656-658). It is not necessary that the release be effected by a payment,
though it might be. The context would need to supply this information, as the
signifier itself does not automatically supply it. Campbell then goes on to
explain the connection between justification and redemption:

From his apocalyptic perspective, [J. Louis
Martyn](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/ruminating-romans-faithing-
in-the-faith-of-christ/) also supports a liberative construal of
justification. He observes that St Paul rarely speaks of repentance and
forgiveness in his letters. This is one of those facts one simply does not
notice until it is brought to one’s attention. It’s odd, isn’t it? Repentance
enjoys decisive significance throughout the Scriptures and the Jewish
tradition and Christian traditions; yet Paul doesn’t spend much time talking
about it.

Lapide’s simple argument represents a cogent critique of Christianity. If the
death and resurrection of Christ has inaugurated the kingdom, where is it? The
world looks the same—only the deck chairs have been moved around a bit. No
doubt St Paul was confronted with similar questions. How might he have
answered? I suspect he would have pointed to the Church: “Look! God is
creating communities of love and faith filled with the promised Holy Spirit.
Jews and Gentiles, men and women, rich and poor, slaves and freemen—we are now
united in the Supper of the Lamb. The old prophesies are coming true. Open
your eyes!”

_But now apart from the law the righteousness of God (although it is attested
by the law and the prophets) has been disclosed—namely, the righteousness of
God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is
no distinction, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. But
they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus. God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat
accessible through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because
God in his forbearance had passed over the sins previously committed. This was
also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time, so that he would be
just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus’ faithfulness.
(Rom 3:21-26)_

Back in seminary I remember reading Massey Shepherd’s book [_The Paschal

Good eye, Matushka Mary! They took it out of the box and took a photo of it

If you ever get a chance to read it, I’d be interested in your response to his

Although I admit to still being fearful, I know this says more about ME than
it does God. Scripture makes it clear that those perfected by love do not
fear. Why? Because fear has to do with torment (punishment!)  
This encapsulates the Hope of the gospel for me, that it truly IS good news,
because FEAR does not come from God at ALL!  
Those who would use the term ‘fear OF God’ talk of a different KIND of fear.
One we do not realise IS fear and has been lost from our understanding
(understandably as we are a fearful human race! Who are, if we are truthful in
love WITH the wrong fear..) that fear is not FEAR at all. But AWE. Like seeing
a breathtaking sunset and having no words for what it inspires in one.

I really enjoyed Thomas Talbot’s book on the ultimate Salvation of All.  
Also, Professor Ilaria Ramelli’s book: “A larger Hope?–Universal Salvation” is
a very thorough work on what the great majority of the ‘Patristics’ saints in
the first five centuries of church history believed about the ultimate
reconciliation/salvation of All.

Talbott acknowledges that not all Christian theologians consistently think
through the logic of their respective evangelical claims:

by Thomas Talbott in 2011. I do not recall who directed me to this book. All I
know is that I read it cover to cover and found it com­pel­ling. At the time I
was what is called a “hopeful univer­sal­ist” and had been since reading
[_Dare We Hope “That All Men Be

by Hans Urs von Balthasar in the mid-90s. I found it an easy step from C. S.
Lewis’s God who invites us to take a bus ride to heaven to Balthasar’s God of
absolute love who has embraced every human being in the death and
resur­rec­tion of Christ. Yet we live under judg­ment, Balthasar reminds us:
while we may _hope_ that all will be saved, we cannot claim to _know_ that
such will be the case. We still await final judgment. _No problema_. Who was I
to argue with the great Balthasar. I’d rather hope for the salvation of all
than not. But the distinction between hope and knowing continued to needle. It
didn’t make sense to me at the level of proclamation and faith. Later I
discovered Met Kallistos Ware invoking the same distinction.

Proposition 1 is easy to affirm. We can all believe that God wants us all.

Having heard much good about Talbott’s book for years, I have it in my stack.
Must get around to reading it one of these years.

their shins) making God a judge and putting us in the dock. Which naturally
leads to us being guilty and the judge punishing in sentencing! This is not
scriptural at all. But a bending of scripture in the very worst way.

But I can affirm it, especially from the arguments I’ve seen so far about the
nature of God, the nature of free will, and the moral argument. No need to
recap those arguments here, and I’m still exploring/ingesting them. But I do
want to say here that it’s been a revelation to me how much of universalism is
in accord with reason and logic, and can be worked out in that sphere. There
is a hell of a lot (pardon) about faith that involves trust, and the heart,
but a heck of a lot of these questions about salvation and ETC ask only logic
rather than some blind leap.

Well put. Then it goes to the question of the moral character of God – what
kind of God it is that one believes in?

If I believe that God genuinely loves every human being and desires their
eternal salvation and that, nevertheless, some human beings will be eternally
lost, then I cannot logically affirm the eschatological triumph of God’s
universal salvific will. If I believe that God will effectively bring his
elect to eternal salvation and that, nevertheless, some human beings will be
eternally lost, then I cannot logically affirm that his love intends every
human being. And if I believe that God loves every human being and that his
atoning work is decisively efficacious, then I cannot logically affirm the
eternal damnation of some.

For it is clear, before ALL things, God is first a Father. And a Good Father
at that! And a good father does not condemn his child but seeks to restore
them. God does not punish. He doesn’t have too! Our actions have punishment
attached! God, on the other hand is always running towards us. Or waiting
beside us. Desperate to jump in to help!

If that had been in the physical world it would have been easier! Far easier.
Because we do not see the reality of our sin. But in eternity it is harder!
Yet still Marley does it. And that to me says it all. (I do truly think A
Christmas carol should be part of our scripture! It has so many lessons for
us!) it is US who condemn OURSELVES into our own hell of condemnation, not
God. The hell of our condemnation. Never of Gods.

Belief in the eternal damnation of the incorrigibly wicked has characterized
ecumenical Christianity since the seventh century.

After leaving evangelicalism behind, I was a hopeful universalist until I read
DBH’s That All Shall Be Saved. That book caused the scales to fall from my
eyes with surprising ease and speed.

One immediately notes the logical inconsistency of the three propositions. One
can reasonably affirm two of them; but one cannot affirm all three without
contradiction.

When I read _The Inescapable Love of God_ , I found my hope for universal
reconciliation growing exponentially. Such is the quiet forcefulness of
Talbott’s exegesis of the New Testament (especially of the Apostle Paul) and
his philosophical critique of traditional formulations of eternal damnation.
Is it really obvious that Jesus and his Apostles taught everlasting perdition?
If God is omnipotent Love, is it really beyond his resources to effect the
salvation of all without compromising the integrity of personal freedom? If
God is merciful Love, then how could his justice require the condemnation of
even a single human being to everlasting torment? And what is freedom? What is
justice? What is love? Talbott tackles all of these questions with precision
and care. But most importantly, he offers a vision of the victorious gospel of
Jesus Christ that is worthy of proclamation and faith:

I’ve just discovered this site, after reading That All Shall Be Saved (and
blogging about it a little). This has all been very bracing for my poor faith,
so thank you. It’s been like rediscovering the Good News for the first time.

Oh how terrible! The shining light of the gospel is undermined with every
“waffle” that is added: God is all good, all powerful and all loving – but
apparently this is not so. The empty tomb put an end to death, but not really.
The gospel is good news, but not really. Who wants to believe in that?

Proposition 2 is where some work or decision is required, as you say, for any
hopeful, because there are obstacles; and simply because it’s a greater claim.
To say that God wants us all doesn’t say nearly as much as declaring that God
will win us all in the end.

Even Augustine admitted in his time that there were ‘a great many’ Christians
who believed in the ultimate salvation/reconciliation of All. He called them
“Doctors of Mercy”. Origen didn’t originate ‘Apokatastasis’. It all comes from
God’s Word in the Greek text, including the O.T. Septuagent.

Now, even though I agree that Dr Ramelli’s book on the early history of
Christian universalism is (by quite a wide margin) the most thorough one on
this subject (as well as a *very* precious mine of information), it does *not*
actually describe what the GREAT majority of the Fathers (and Mothers)
believed during the first 5 centuries of Christianity… Simply because there’s
MANY more Fathers and Mothers than what most people assume.  
It *does* however talk about what the great majority of the *most important*
Fathers and Mothers supposedly believed during the first 5 centuries of
Christianity, albeit especially the *Eastern* ones (simply because
universalism was much more popular in the East than in the West).  
Furthermore, although the evidence she provides us with in the book is often
strong (even *very* strong, at times), it is also relatively frequently *not*
that strong… Objectively speaking, she *does* overstate her case quite a few
times.  
The truth is, we will unfortunately NEVER get to truly know with *absolute
certainty* what most Fathers and Mothers actually believed when it comes to
the Last Things… And that’s simply because too many of their works have not
“survived” the passage of time and might very well be lost forever.  
For Fathers and Mothers like Ambrose of Caesarea, Gregory Thaumaturgus,
Firmilian of Caesarea, Alexander of Jerusalem, Pierius of Alexandria,
Theognostus of Alexandria, Palladius of Galatia and Melania the Elder (among
many others), all we are “condemned” to have is this : we know they were VERY
heavily influenced by Origen (and Evagrius, in the case of Palladius) and that
Origen (and Evagrius) were *both* universalists for whom universalism was of
*paramount* theological importance.  
We also know that they typically “surrounded” themselves with fellow priests,
teachers and ascetics that were *also* very heavily influenced by Origen.  
In the case of Gregory Thaumaturgus, we *also* know that Rufinus of Aquileia
wrote that this great student of Origen taught his teacher’s universalism
“without hesitation”, if memory serves me well (and it usually does).  
For *these* Fathers and Mothers (and then again, many more, actually), this is
either all we have or *almost* all we have.  
That’s enough for us to *rationally* assume that they WERE indeed very likely
to have been at LEAST sympathetic towards universalism (if not ardent
universalists)… But that isn’t exactly *absolute proof* either.

We have a God whose mercy we are told over and over again, lasts FOREVER. Why
would it be forever unless someone was offered it? Someone needed it? To
exclude even one, is to exclude all. Yet God always hopes. Why? Because we
desperately need Him too! We need Him to hope we will change, have faith we
will and love us so we can! And these three things, Paul assures us, do indeed
last forever! Thank God He is as HE is! For it is He that saves us! Not OF
OURSELVES, but His free gift TO us. For that is a good Father. That is a good
gospel. Eternally hopeful in the father. Knowing, as Paul said, that some how,
some way, God Himself as FATHER (not even as Christ!) will be ALL in ALL. And
that THIS is the fulfilment of the scriptures.

The decisive _triumph_ of God’s salvific will was affirmed by universalists in
the patristic period (most famously by Origen, St Gregory of Nyssa, and St
Isaac of Nineveh) and in a different way by St Augustine of Hippo and his
followers in the Latin Church, who restricted the triumph of the divine
salvific will to the predestined. Today support for the proposition is largely
restricted to Calvinist and universalist circles.

The ‘judgement’ of God is not to do with punishing. It is to do with getting
us OUT of our punishment mind set! And restoring us to Christ! Think. In
Scrooge, Marley shows the spirits in their own torment. Why? The condemnation
they have heaped on their OWN head when they realise they are not part
material reality any longer and cannot change the selfish ways they lived!
They are now only spirit, and cannot change what has been lived by them. Part
of Marleys redemption is the crumb of love (he did not even know he had!) for
Scrooge. And using it to get the help for him. Probably the first selfless act
he ever does. So much more painful because he thinks he IS indeed facing
eternal wandering and loneliness! Yet. Rather than not care, or just be
wrapped up in his own suffering, he goes to Scrooge to STOP scrooges suffering
the same fate if he can!

Talbott begins his analysis of damnation and universal restoration by
presenting us with three propositions:

If you’re pressed for time I would recommend reading the last chapter or two
in the near future just to have that tumbling around in your mind until you
read the whole book. At least in my experience, there’s just something about
the way Talbott sums everything up that makes it absolutely clear that God is
better than we can imagine.

Thanks for the tip. In terms of knowing that “God is better than we can
imagine”, I’m already there; I don’t need Talbott’s book to convince me any
further. I do intend to read it one day; I just have so many other books I
intend to read too 🙂

I know the feeling. I own more books I haven’t read than books I have.

As a Catholic child, and a lapsed one, I’ve always assumed Purgatory rather
than eternal conscious torment, so I can easily drop proposition 3. DBH, and
evidently many others, have shown just how incoherent it is.

The _universality_ of God’s salvific will is affirmed by Eastern Christians,
Lutherans, Anglicans, Arminian Protestants. Matters are a bit more confusing
in Latin Catholicism because of the historical influence of St Augustine’s
formulation of absolute predestina­tion; but recent magisterial teaching has
clarified that God offers salvation to all.

I cannot speak for Dr Talbott’s book since I have not read it, though I do
have good reason to believe it is a good read and no reason to doubt it.

That’s certainly true for me, and I’ve read quite a lot of books.

Gorman is not persuaded by Campbell’s arguments that Rom 1:18-3:20 is an
extended diatribe, but he does seem to agree with Campbell that Rom 5-8 is the
heart of the epistle. He concludes:

Posted on [1 August 2013](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/ruminating-
romans-was-paul-a-diatribalist/ "10:22 pm") by [Fr Aidan
Kimel](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/author/akimel/ "View all posts by Fr
Aidan Kimel")

Is there any ambiguity here about who is doing the objecting and who is doing
the answering, about which voice represents Gregory’s own and which represents
that of his Arian opponents? If the voices of a diatribe are not clearly
differentiated, there is no diatribe. And, no, I don’t think one gets around
this problem by supposing that Phoebe or some other reader of the letter was
given “stage directions” on how to read it. Can one find other classical
diatribes where such “stage directions” are necessary for the diatribe, as
diatribe, to be intelligible?

You write “that the text says nothing about a necessity of submitting to
Torah.” Are you referring to the letter as a whole, 1:18-3:20, or 1:18-32? You
are right that 1:18-32 does not say anything about submitting to Torah, but I
never said that it did. Campbell’s belief that Paul is addressing, at least in
some parts of the letter, some of the same issues that he addressed in
Galatians is grounded on Campbell’s reading of the letter as a whole and its
strong similarities to Galatians.

For a sympathetic but critical review of Campbell’s proposal, see Michael
Gorman, “Douglas Campbell’s _The Deliverance of God_ , Journal for the Study
of Paul and His Letters 1.1 (Spring 2011): 99-107.

If Rom 1:18-3:20 in fact is a conversation between Paul and the Teacher, what
would it look like? Fortunately, someone else on the net has done the hard
work for us:

A huge problem that we have is that we are only able to listen in to one side
of the conversation. We have no clue what was going on in Rome at the time. We
have no clue why Paul wrote his letter and what he hoped to gain by it.
Exegetes posit various hypotheses, and each hypothesis affects the
interpretation of the letter. As the saying goes, You pays your money and
takes your chances. 🙂

Brethren, this morning I stumbled upon the [Fenton translation of the New
Testament](http://thetencommandmentsministry.us/ministry/ferrar_fenton/pdf/romans.pdf)
(early 20th century). Check out how he marks Rom 3-4 as a conversation between
Paul and an imaginary Jewish opponent. Fenton’s translation does not support
Campbell’s thesis about Rom 1-2, but it does alert us to the possible presence
of diatribe in Romans.

I checked my commentaries. Dunn writes: “ _gar_ , ‘for,’ can express simply
connection or continuation of thought without specifying what precisely the
connection is. That a connection of thought is certainly intended is clear
from the parallel structuring of vv 17 and 18.” He then goes on to suggest
that the connection “is as much of contrast as of cause.” Fitzmyer takes a
similar view. Byrne, on the other hand, suggests a causal reading. Wright is
silent about _gar_. I note that virtually all the English translations use the
word “for.” I’m going to have to let you NT Greek readers argue out this
question. 🙂

Scholars have long recognized the presence of diatribal material in Paul’s
letters (e.g., Rom 3:1-9); but as we shall see, Campbell believes that the
diatribal device is used far more extensively in Romans than heretofore
believed. For example, he believes that Rom 1:18-32 in fact is spoken by the
opponent whom Paul is seeking to refute. Go pick up your Bible and quickly
read through this passage. You will probably have the same initial reaction
that I did: there are no clues whatsoever that Paul has shifted into a
diatribal mode. But, Campbell responds, that is because we are reading the
text in an English translation. In the original Greek, however, one can
discern a definite change in literary style; in fact, the stylistic
differences have led some scholars to speculate that this long passage was
interpolated into Paul’s letter. Campbell, along with most scholars, rejects
the suggestion of interpolation; but that still leaves us with the question,
why the change? The unusual style, he argues, signals “a change in authorial
voice” (p. 534). The original readers of the letter would have recognized the
shift. The change in authorial voice doesn’t automatically announce “here
comes a diatribe!” but it does tell the reader that something different may be
going on here.

Campbell then goes on to remind us of something that we all already know but
probably have never thought much about—namely, Paul composed his letters with
the expectation that they would be read aloud to the recipients. Think
auditors, not readers. Consider this for a second. If Romans was originally
composed to be spoken, and if he composed part of it as diatribe, then he
probably would have given the bearer of the letter (Phoebe? [Rom 16:1-2])
sufficient instruction on how it was to be read:

I have never looked at the New Testament epistles in this light, and yet it’s
obvious. If I have written a letter with the intention that it is to be read
out loud to a group of people, I will be sure that the letter-reader
understands what I have written, and I will instruct him how to perform it
properly. And if I have employed the rhetorical device of diatribe in the
letter, I will probably instruct him, for example, to alter the intonation and
quality of his voice when he speaks “in character,” just so the audience
cannot miss the dialogue between “persons.” And if I am parodying my
opponent’s position, then the change in voice actually becomes crucial. This
is not something new for first century audiences–they have heard this kind of
discourse many times before.

But having said this, the fact also remains that we are still left with a
number of exegetical problems regarding Romans 1-4. Campbell solves these
interpretive problems by in essence removing them. 1:18-3:20 become virtually
irrelevant for the interpretation of the letter as a whole. This may be be too
much of a nifty trick.

4) Also, if ch. 1, v. 18 began “The Opposing Teacher’s Introduction of Theme,”
it would not begin with the connecting, inferential particle γάρ (“for”), but
with some adversative particle like ἀλλά (“but”). The word γάρ implies that
what is said follows naturally and logically upon what was said before; no one
would use that word if he meant to deny the immediately preceding affirmation,
or present an opposing thesis.

2) That answerableness to our Maker is not against the theme of grace with
which the epistle as a whole is concerned: the theme of grace _presupposes_
this answerableness, our being subject to divine judgment. It is not as though
one person (a Jewish Christian) says that we are subject to divine judgment,
and another person (Paul, defending grace) says, no, we’re not. Grace means
nothing if divine judgment is not real.

5) The circumstance that, in Campbell’s reading, those parts of Romans chs.
1-3 that get assigned to a legalist interlocutor are those very parts that are
most unpopular and contrary to current cultural presuppositions — e.g., the
idea that homosexual practices are against nature — leaves me, I confess, with
a nagging suspicion that a desire to discredit these teachings has partly
motivated Campbell’s interpretation. Yet it is not only in Romans that St.
Paul says things of this kind (compare 1 Cor 11:14 f.). Attempts to evacuate
the theme of natural law from Pauline teaching strike me as essentially
Gnostic. And an interpretation that would assign some things in Romans chs.
1-3 to a legalist “Teacher” and other things to “Paul” strikes me as worthy of
Marcion, who applied his scissors to the biblical text back in the second
century.

It’s also important to note that Campbell is not saying that Paul disagrees
with everything that the Teacher says. What he might ask us to do, though, is
to confirm our judgments about what Paul teaches on ____ from material
elsewhere in the letter or in the Pauline corpus, lest we end up confusing
Paul’s views with the views of his opponents.

Peter, I am delighted you have chosen to comment. I was hoping that Campbell’s
provocative theses might encourage discussion. As I note in the article, I am
not yet convinced, but I am trying to give them a hearing and to test their
plausibility. Nor am I a scholar. Given that it is probably unlikely I can
persuade Dr Campbell to enter into the discussion here (though it would be
wonderful if he did), I’ll attempt a response to your comments and at least
push the discussion along.

5) I think it is always possible, indeed likely, that the personal views of
the interpreter will often inform the interpreter’s interpretations. Regarding
natural law, Campbell appears to be following in the footsteps of Barth and
Kasemann, whose opposition to natural law was not a result of disagreement
with any of Paul’s ethical positions but based on other considerations. I can
see why supporters of homosexual unions, e.g., would like Campbell’s proposal;
but I would hope that the traditional Christian understanding of sexuality is
not dependent on a few verses in Romans. If it is, we are all in trouble.

So even if we ultimately find Campbell’s thesis implausible, we are still
stuck with the challenge of finding the best reading of chaps. 1-4.

2) Did I say that Campbell says that Paul says that we are not answerable to
God? I don’t think I did, but I will be touching on this in my next article,
where I will explore further what Campbell believes the Teacher was teaching.

**When did these come into being? They are above all “When.” But, if I am to
speak with something more of boldness, — when the Father did. And when did the
Father come into being? There never was a time when He was not. And the same
thing is true of the Son and the Holy Ghost. Ask me again, and again I will
answer you, When was the Son begotten? When the Father was not begotten. And
when did the Holy Ghost proceed? When the Son was, not proceeding but,
begotten — beyond the sphere of time, and above the grasp of reason….** (Or.
29.3.)

Campbell wrote a response to Gorman in the same issue, but I do not presently
have access to that article.

Try reading the above “script” out loud, changing your voice for Paul and the
Teacher. Does it make sense as a dialogue? And remember: according to
Campbell, the Teacher is a Jewish-Christian who is urging Gentile Christians
to submit fully to Torah (in other words, to become Jews) so that they may
partake in the fullness of salvation (see “[Why Did St Paul Write his
Epistle?](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/ruminating-romans-why-did-
st-paul-write-his-epistle/)“; also listen to [this audio interview with
Campbell](http://www.gci.org/playaudio?program=YI/YI096&title=Douglas+Campbell:+Understanding+the+Book+of+Romans+\(audio+only\))).
Through the diatribal debate St Paul hopes to pull the rug out from under the
Teacher by demonstrating that his teaching on law and final judgment can be
easily turned back upon him.

Now, it is true that, in ch. 2 of Romans, St. Paul addresses an (imaginary)
interlocutor; he starts off the chapter by addressing, in the second person, ὦ
ἄνθρωπε πᾶς ὁ κρίνων, “every man that judgest,” a phrase which is repeated
nearly verbatim in v. 3; the interlocutor is later identified more
specifically as a Jew, someone who rests his hope in the law, v. 17. Yet, in
reading that chapter, I do not get the impression that St. Paul is bouncing
back and forth between his own voice and that of a hypothetical interlocutor,
a “Teacher.” Look, for example, at how your internet interpreter, who has
divided up this supposed exchange, assigns, in Romans 3:3-4, the question to
Paul (“What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the
faithfulness of God?”) and the answer to “the Teacher” (“By no means! Although
everyone is a liar, let God be proved true…”); then, a little further down, in
Romans 3:9, the question is assigned to Paul (“What then? Are we any better
off?”) and the answer is assigned to Paul, too (“No, not at all; for we have
already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin”).
The two passages are, structurally, entirely parallel, a rhetorical question
followed by an immediate denial; yet the Campbell thesis supposes that one
must assign the first denial to “the Teacher,” and the second denial to Paul
himself. Such a way of dividing up the text seems to me completely arbitrary.

4) Given my Greek incompetence, I cannot offer an opinion about _gar_. But
here’s what Campbell says:

Campbell identifies the interpretive problems in his book, but let me just
mention a couple that I saw when I re-read Romans this summer. (a) Who is Paul
talking to or about in 2:1ff? Why does he suddenly shift from his indictment
of pagan sin in 1:18-32 and then start talking about judgmentalism? Precisely
who is he accusing of being guilty of all the sins he has just mentioned?
Jews? All Jews? Just non-Christian Jews? If “all Jews,” is he not guilty of a
terrible caricature and misrepresentation? (b) How do we reconcile Paul’s
claim in 2:4-11 that God will “repay everyone according to their works” with
his later claim about justification by faith? A lot of commentators have
struggled with that one. (c ) Who is Paul talking about in 2:12-13? Non-
Christian Gentiles? Christian Gentiles? If the former, how do we reconcile
this with his clear teaching in chaps 5-8 that the unregenerate are enslaved
by the powers of sin and death and need to be liberated and reborn in the
Spirit. Is it not the Spirit who circumsizes the heart, yet Paul seems to be
saying that Torah is already written on the hearts of (some) Gentiles. For
this reason some commentators suggest that Paul is talking about Christian
Gentiles here, but the text does not say that, does it? And the list goes on.

3) This, I think, is your strongest objection, and I find it to be a weighty
one. Campbell’s case would be strengthened immeasurably if he could produce
one or more ancient texts where the diatriable conversation is not clearly
marked in some way. If he can’t, then his argument probably will not convince
many people. The way Campbell divides up the diatribal conversation does have
the feel of arbitrariness (at least it does to someone like me, who is totally
dependent on English translations).

3) I have read diatribes and other works where more than one voice is implied.
Take, for instance, the Song of Songs. There is clearly a change of voice
between one who says “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” and one
who answers, saying, “If thou know not, O thou fairest among women….” That is
to say, it is a love song; there is a man and a woman speaking (and, perhaps,
a chorus, the daughters of Jerusalem). No one who reads the work with any
attentiveness can fail to notice this. But as for a diatribe: I know that
you’ve been reading St. Gregory the Theologian’s _Theological Orations_
lately. Take the Third Theological Oration, for example. Here is a passage:

This possibility does not, of course, prove that Paul composed Rom 1:18-32 as
a speech spoken by the opponent whose views he is seeking to refute; but we at
least have to entertain the possibility and determine whether Campbell’s
proposal offers a superior reading of the letter.

Campbell has not yet convinced me, but I am intrigued. If it’s true, this will
solve many problems that have befuddled exegetes and theologians in their
reading of Romans 1-4.

a Diatribalist?").

1) I do not know how to weigh the fact that the early commentators did not
recognize the presence of diatribal material in chaps 1-2. Campbell would
probably respond that the “stage directions” got lost fairly early on. Of
course, this possibility can be neither proven nor disproven.

I have not read Campbell’s book, so my assessment of what he is saying is
based solely on your presentation of his ideas above. But, that being said, I
do not find Campbell’s interpretation persuasive — for a number of reasons.

I am not well acquainted with the patristic commentary tradition on Romans,
though I am reading Chrysostom right along with my other commentaries. Do the
Fathers all agree? Do you think they had a good grasp of the key issues that
Paul addressed in his letter? How do we settle disputes between contemporary
exegetes and patristic exegetes? Rightly or wrongly, when I want to understand
one of Paul’s letters, I will always turn to my modern commentaries (Catholic
and Protestant) before I look at pre-20th century commentators. Perhaps that
is a weakness on my part.

1) The Church has read the Epistle to the Romans for nearly 2000 years now.
Nowhere do we find those commentators who lived near St. Paul’s own time and
spoke St. Paul’s own language reading the text of Romans ch. 1 as though two
different speakers were implied in it, as though, when the text speaks of “the
wrath of God” being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, it is not St. Paul himself who is asserting this, but
“a Jewish-Christian who is urging Gentile Christians to submit fully to
Torah.” That text, in fact, says nothing about a necessity of submitting to
Torah; rather, the text asserts that there is a knowledge of good and evil
that is naturally implanted in all men; all of us, whether dimly or keenly,
are aware of God, and aware of his judgment. If pagans have tried to deny that
knowledge and deaden their awareness of divine judgment by idolatry on the one
hand and by immoral sexual practices on the other, nevertheless we cannot, as
God’s rational creatures, escape being answerable to our Maker.

But Campbell is upfront on his opposition to the “[justification by faith”
model](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2013/06/02/justifying-justification-by-
faith/), which has dominated Protestant exegesis since the Reformation.
Campbell may be guilty of bending over backwards to read Paul in a way that
opens up other interpretive possibilities. Specifically, he wants us to read
Romans 1-4 in light of 5-8, rather than vice-versa. And on this point I agree
with him 99%.

I look forward to any further reflections you might have, Peter. And thanks
again for your comment.
